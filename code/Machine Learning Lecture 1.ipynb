      "Tom Mitchell defines what it means for a computer program to learn in the following way: \u201cA computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\u201d\n",
      "\n",
      "This definition highlights a key difference between machine learning and classical statistical methods.  That is, machine learning is chiefly concerned with improving future performance based on prior experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another key difference with classical statistical methods is that machine learning focuses on the computational efficiency (in both time and space) of algorithms.  For instance, an active area of machine learning research is to create algorithms that have computational efficiency properties that work with \u201cbig data\u201d.\n",

First, we will be working with a dataset of Boston real estate prices.  In order to load the data and print out a detailed description of this dataset use the following code:"

When doing classification, you will want to use both a evaluation function (to use the terminology in the Domingos paper) and a different learning algorithm.  To get started we will use an algorithm called multiple logistic regression that is built into scikit-learn.  Specifically, we will be building a model to classify images of handwritten digits.\n",
