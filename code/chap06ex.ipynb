Data collected in 2013 is available from http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/cpstables/032013/hhinc/toc.htm. I downloaded `hinc06.xls`, which is an Excel spreadsheet with information about household income, and converted it to `hinc06.csv`, a CSV file you will find in the repository for this book. You will also find `hinc2.py`, which reads this file and transforms the data.\n",

    "To estimate mean and other statistics from these data, we have to make some assumptions about the lower and upper bounds, and how the values are distributed in each range. `hinc2.py` provides `InterpolateSample`, which shows one way to model this data. It takes a `DataFrame` with a column, `income`, that contains the upper bound of each range, and `freq`, which contains the number of respondents in each frame.\n",
