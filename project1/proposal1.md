# Exploring the NSDUH dataset
Ariana Olson

## Summary
I would like to look at trends in drug use in the United States, specifically the use of opioids. I hope to find how much the opioid epidemic contributes to the decreasing life expectancy in the United States. I would also like to look at how opioid use compares to the use of other drugs in the US.

## Data

### Datasets
I will be using the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), as well as possibly supplmenting information from other datasets the Substance Abuse & mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA). The NSDUH set has data for the most years, reaching back to the 1970s, so it will be the main dataset used. I am still looking for datasets that might help me determine life expectancy and death rates in the US per year.

### Terms of Use
The main dataset that I am using is the NSDUH. The full terms of service for this data can be found on the [SAMHSA site](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/info/terms-use-nid3422). The main points of these terms is:
- The data may not be used in a way that would identify any specific research subjects.
- You must reference the bibliographic citation in your publication.
- You must send a citation of your published works to SAMHSA.

### Ethical Considerations
Privacy is probably the most significant ethical consideration fo rthis project. Identifying subjects in the dataset is a breach of privacy that could be incredibly damaging.

Along with privacy, I want to be careful to not moralize drug use in my writing. Addiction is a sensitive topic, and it is important to be considerate of the fact that some members of my audience may be sensitive to discussions about addiction, especially because I am not an expert on this topic or a doctor. The goal of this project is to synthesize data and find connections, not to perscribe a fix to the problem on a systematic or personal level.

## Questions
- What have been the trends in drug use since the NSDUH began collecting data?
- Is there a link between the opioid epidemic and life expectancy?
