# Abstract: Exploring OxyContin Use in the United States 
In this investigation, I explored the responses to questions pertaining to OxyContin use in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). This investigation was motivated by wanting to understand more about how the opioid crisis affects Americans. I investigated the age that respondents reported first trying OxyContin in a way that was not directed by a doctor and the frequency of use by people who reported ever taking OxyContin in a way not directed by their doctor. Most of the findings pointed to the data not being coded as I expected based on the descriptions in the NSDUH codebooks, however, so I could conclude very little about these questions except that an investigation is required into why the data did not always make sense.
