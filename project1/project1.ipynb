It is interesting to note that the maximum number of days respondents took it non-medically is 50, as opposed to 360 in the previous section. I can imagine a couple of reasons why. One is that people who used OxyContin non-medically had a prescription, or knew someone with a prescription, and they may have used it non-medically for a temporary severe pain they were experiencing instead of going to the doctor. I have anecdotal evidence from several aquaintences that is consistent with this guess. Another reason may be that it is more difficult to obtain OxyContin so regularly without a prescription, so people are much less likely to use the drug frequently unless they have a medical reason to use it. A final reason may be that OxyContin is very strong, and people with opioid dependencies may be more likely to use a less strong drug more frequently. This would require more data on other types of opioids to test."

    "There are some aspects of these CDFs that are expected. The first is that the maximum age increases with the ages represented. This makes sense because of the upper bounds of the age range. People cannot report having tried OxyContin non-medically for the first time at an age greater than the age they were when they took the survey. It might be worth noting that the three youngest age groups have a maximum that is within 1 year of the oldest respondents in the group, and the three older age groups have a larger gap between the maximum value and the oldest age represented by the group. This is consistent with the fact that people are more likely to try OxyContin non-medically for the first time in their 20s.\n",

    "Another aspect of the CDFs to point out is that the distributions for age ranges 20-29, 30-34, and 35-49 all appear to be roughly the same shape. This is also expected because these groups are young enough to have tried OxyContin for the first time in the IQR of ages that all respondents have tried OxyContin non-medically for the first time. The FDA approved OxyContin in 1995 ([source](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drugsafety/informationbydrugclass/ucm338566.htm)). So, someone who was 34 years old in 2014 would have been about 15 in 1995."

I think if I were to look at multiple years of the NSDUH survey, I would investigate if this minimum is consistently smaller than the minimums of the other age groups. If it is, and this is a statistically significant result, that might indicate that people are trying OxyContin at increasingly younger ages."
