\label{preface}

\section*{Why I wrote this book}

{\em Think Stats: Probability and Statistics for Programmers} is an
introduction to the practical tools of exploratory data analysis.

When I start working with a new dataset, I follow these steps:

\begin{itemize}

\item Importing and cleaning: Whatever format the data is in, it
usually takes some time and effort to read the data, clean and transform
it, and check that everything made it through the translation process
intact.

\item Single variable explorations: I usually start by examining one
  variable at a time, finding out what the values mean and what
  distributions of the variables are, and identifying appropriate
  summary statistics.

\item Pair-wise explorations: To identify possible relationships
  between variables, I look at tables and scatter plots, and compute
  correlations and linear fits.

\item Multivariate analysis: If there are apparent relationships
  between variables, I use multiple regression to add control variables
  and investigate more complex relationships.

\item Estimation and hypothesis testing: When reporting statistical
  results, it is important to answer three questions: How big is
  the effect?  How much variability should we expect if we run the same
  measurement again?  Is it likely that the apparent effect could be
  due to chance?

\item Visualization: During exploration, visualization is an important 
  tool for finding possible relationships and effects.  Then if an
  apparent effect holds up to scrutiny, visualization is an effective
  way to communicate results.

\end{itemize}


This books takes a computational approach, which has several
advantages:

\begin{itemize}

\item I present most ideas using simple Python code, rather than
  mathematical notation.  In general, Python code is more readable;
  also, because it is executable, readers can download it, run it,
  and modify it.

\item Each chapter includes exercises readers can do to develop
  and solidify their learning.  When you write programs, you
  express your understanding in code; while you are debugging the
  program, you are also correcting your understanding.

\item Some exercises involve running experiments to test statistical
  behavior.  For example, you can explore the Central Limit Theorem
  (CLT) by generating random samples and computing their sums.  The
  resulting visualizations demonstrate why the CLT works, and when
  it doesn't.

\item Some ideas that are hard to grasp mathematically are easy to
  understand by simulation.  For example, we approximate p-values by
  running Monte Carlo simulations, which reinforces the meaning of the
  p-value.

\item Because the book is based on a general-purpose programming language
  (Python), readers can import data from almost any
  source.  They are not limited to data that has been cleaned and
  formatted for a particular statistics tool.

\end{itemize}

The book lends itself to a project-based approach.  In my class,
students work on a semester-long project that requires them to pose a
statistical question, find a dataset that can address it, and apply
each of the techniques they learn to their own data.

To demonstrate my approach to exploratory data analysis, the book
presents a case study that runs through all of the chapters.  It uses
data from two sources:

\begin{itemize}

\item The National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), conducted by the
  U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to gather
  ``information on family life, marriage and divorce, pregnancy,
  infertility, use of contraception, and men's and women's health.''
  (See \url{http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm}.)

\item The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS),
  conducted by the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
  Health Promotion to ``track health conditions and risk behaviors in
  the United States.''  (See \url{http://cdc.gov/BRFSS/}.)

\end{itemize}

Other examples use data from the IRS, the U.S. Census, and
the Boston Marathon.


\section*{How I wrote this book}

When people write a new textbook, they usually start by
reading a stack of old textbooks.  As a result, most books
contain the same material in pretty much the same order.  Often there
are phrases, and errors, that propagate from one book to the next;
Stephen Jay Gould pointed out an example in his essay, ``The Case of
the Creeping Fox Terrier.''\footnote{A breed of dog that is about half
  the size of a Hyracotherium (see
  \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyracotherium}).}

I did not do that.  In fact, I used almost no printed material while I
was writing this book, for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}

\item My goal was to explore a new approach to this material, so I didn't
want much exposure to existing approaches.

\item Since I am making this book available under a free license, I wanted
to make sure that no part of it was encumbered by copyright restrictions.

\item Many readers of my books don't have access to libraries of
printed material, so I tried to make references to resources that are
freely available on the Internet.

\item Some proponents of old media think that the exclusive
use of electronic resources is lazy and unreliable.  They might be right
about the first part, but I think they are wrong about the second, so
I wanted to test my theory.

% http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/rts/nmrt/news/footnotes/may2010/in_defense_of_wikipedia_bonnett.cfm

\end{itemize}

The resource I used more than any other is Wikipedia, the bugbear
of librarians everywhere.  In general, the articles I read on
statistical topics were very good (although I made a few small changes
along the way).  I include references to Wikipedia pages throughout
the book and I encourage you to follow those links; in many cases, the
Wikipedia page picks up where my description leaves off.  The
vocabulary and notation in this book are generally consistent with
Wikipedia, unless I had a good reason to deviate.
Other resources I found useful were Wolfram MathWorld and (of course)
Google.

\section*{Using the code}
\label{code}

% TODO: add note about Python 2/3 and print, division

The code and data used in this book are available from
\url{https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2}.  Git is a version
control system that allows you to keep track of the files that
make up a project.  A collection of files under Git's control is
called a {\bf repository}.  GitHub is a hosting service that provides
storage for Git repositories and a convenient web interface.

The GitHub homepage for my repository provides several ways to
work with the code:

\begin{itemize}

\item You can create a copy of my repository
on GitHub by pressing the {\sf Fork} button.  If you don't already
have a GitHub account, you'll need to create one, but if you do, you'll
have your own repository on GitHub that you can use to keep track
of code you write while working on this book.

\item You can also {\bf clone}
my repository, which means that you create a copy of the files on
your computer.  You don't need a GitHub account to do this, but you
won't be able to write your changes back to my repository.

\item If you don't want to use Git at all, you can download the files
in a Zip file.

\end{itemize}

The code in this book is written to work in both Python 2 and Python 3
with no translation.  However, you will need the following packages
installed: 

\begin{itemize}

\item pandas for representing and analyzing data,
  \url{http://pandas.pydata.org/}.

\item NumPy for basic numerical computation, \url{http://www.numpy.org/}.

\item SciPy for scientific computation including statistics,
  \url{http://www.scipy.org/}.

\item matplotlib for visualization, \url{http://matplotlib.org/}.

\end{itemize}

Although these are commonly-used packages, they are not included with
all Python installations, and they can be hard to install in some
environments.  I developed this book using Anaconda from Continuum
Analytics, which is a free Python distribution that includes all
packages you'll need to run the code (and lots more).

I found Anaconda easy to install.  By default it does a user-level
installation, not system-level, so you don't need administrative
privilege.  And it supports both Python 2 and Python 3.  You can
download Anaconda from \url{http://continuum.io/downloads}.

After you clone the repository or unzip the zip file, you should
have a file called {\tt ThinkStats2/code/nsfg.py}.  If you run it,
it should read a data file, run some tests, and print a message
like, ``All tests passed.''  If you get import errors, it probably
means there are some packages you need to install.

Most exercises use Python scripts, but some also use the iPython
notebook.  If you have not used iPython notebook before, I suggest
you start with the documentation at
\url{http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html}.

\chapter{Data science for programmers}
\label{intro}

The thesis of this book is that data, combined with practical
methods, can answer questions and guide decisions under uncertainty.

As an example, I present a case study motivated by a question
I heard when my wife and I were expecting our first child: do first
babies tend to arrive late?
\index{first babies}

If you Google this question, you will find plenty of discussion.  Some
people claim it's true, others say it's a myth, and some people say
it's the other way around: first babies come early.

In many of these discussions, people provide data to support their
claims.  I found many examples like these:

\begin{quote}

``My two friends that have given birth recently to their first babies,
BOTH went almost 2 weeks overdue before going into labour or being
induced.''

``My first one came 2 weeks late and now I think the second one is
going to come out two weeks early!!''

``I don't think that can be true because my sister was my mother's
first and she was early, as with many of my cousins.''

\end{quote}

Reports like these are called {\bf anecdotal evidence} because they
are based on data that is unpublished and usually personal.  In casual
conversation, there is nothing wrong with anecdotes, so I don't mean
to pick on the people I quoted.
\index{anecdotal evidence}

But we might want evidence that is more persuasive and
an answer that is more reliable.  By those standards, anecdotal
evidence usually fails, because:

\begin{itemize}

\item Small number of observations: If the gestation period is longer
  for first babies, the difference is probably small compared to
  natural variation.  In that case, we might have to compare a large
  number of pregnancies to be sure that a difference exists.
\index{sample size}

\item Selection bias: People who join a discussion of this question
  might be interested because their first babies were late.  In that
  case the process of selecting data would bias the results.
\index{selection bias}
\index{bias!selection}

\item Confirmation bias:  People who believe the claim might be more
  likely to contribute examples that confirm it.  People who doubt the
  claim are more likely to cite counterexamples.
\index{confirmation bias}
\index{bias!confirmation}

\item Inaccuracy: Anecdotes are often personal stories, and often
  misremembered, misrepresented, repeated
  inaccurately, etc.

\end{itemize}

So how can we do better?


\section{A statistical approach}

To address the limitations of anecdotes, we will use the tools
of statistics, which include:

\begin{itemize}

\item Data collection: We will use data from a large national survey
  that was designed explicitly with the goal of generating
  statistically valid inferences about the U.S. population.
\index{data collection}

\item Descriptive statistics: We will generate statistics that
  summarize the data concisely, and evaluate different ways to
  visualize data.
\index{descriptive statistics}

\item Exploratory data analysis: We will look for
  patterns, differences, and other features that address the questions
  we are interested in.  At the same time we will check for
  inconsistencies and identify limitations.
\index{exploratory data analysis}

\item Estimation: We will use data from a sample to estimate
  characteristics of the general population.
\index{estimation}

\item Hypothesis testing: Where we see apparent effects, like a
  difference between two groups, we will evaluate whether the effect
  might have happened by chance.
\index{hypothesis testing}

\end{itemize}

By performing these steps with care to avoid pitfalls, we can
reach conclusions that are more justifiable and more likely to be
correct.


\section{The National Survey of Family Growth}
\label{nsfg}

Since 1973 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
have conducted the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG),
which is intended to gather ``information on family life, marriage and
divorce, pregnancy, infertility, use of contraception, and men's and
women's health. The survey results are used ... to plan health services and
health education programs, and to do statistical studies of families,
fertility, and health.''\footnote{See
  \url{http://cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm}.}
\index{National Survey of Family Growth}
\index{NSFG}

We will use data collected by this survey to investigate whether first
babies tend to come late, and other questions.  In order to use this
data effectively, we have to understand the design of the study.

The NSFG is a {\bf cross-sectional} study, which means that it
captures a snapshot of a group at a point in time.  The most
common alternative is a {\bf longitudinal} study, which observes a
group repeatedly over a period of time.
\index{cross-sectional study}
\index{study!cross-sectional}
\index{longitudinal study}
\index{study!longitudinal}

The NSFG has been conducted seven times; each deployment is called a
{\bf cycle}.  We will use data from Cycle 6, which was conducted from
January 2002 to March 2003.  \index{cycle}

The goal of the survey is to draw conclusions about a {\bf
  population}; the target population of the NSFG is people in the
United States aged 15-44.  \index{population}

The people who participate in a survey are called {\bf respondents}; a
group of respondents is called a {\bf cohort}.  In general,
cross-sectional studies are meant to be {\bf representative}, which
means that every member of the target population has an equal chance
of participating.  Of course that ideal is hard to achieve in
practice, but people who conduct surveys come as close as they can.
\index{respondent} \index{representative}

The NSFG is not representative; instead it is deliberately {\bf
  oversampled}.  The designers of the study recruited three
groups---Hispanics, African-Americans and teenagers---at rates higher
than their representation in the U.S. population.  The reason for
oversampling is to make sure that the number of respondents in each of
these groups is large enough to draw valid statistical inferences.
\index{oversampling}

Of course, the drawback of oversampling is that it is not as easy
to draw conclusions about the general population based on statistics
from the survey.  We will come back to this point later.

When working with this kind of data, it is important to be familiar
with the {\bf codebook} which documents the design of the study, the
survey questions, and the encoding of the responses.  The codebook and
user's guide for the NSFG data are available from
\url{http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/nsfg_cycle6.htm}


\section{Importing the data}

The code and data used in this book are available from
\url{https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkStats2}.
  For information
about downloading and working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.

Once you download the code, you should have a file called {\tt
  ThinkStats2/code/nsfg.py}.  If you run it, it should read a data
file, run some tests, and print a message like, ``All tests passed.''

Let's see what it does.  Pregnancy data from Cycle 6 of the NSFG is in
a file called {\tt 2002FemPreg.dat.gz}.  As the suffixes suggest, it
is a gzip-compressed data file in plain text (ASCII), with fixed width
columns.  Each line in the file contains data about one pregnancy.

The format of the file is documented in {\tt 2002FemPreg.dct}, which
is a Stata dictionary file.  Stata is a statistical software system;
a ``dictionary'' in this context is a list of variable names, types,
and indices that identify where in each line to find each variable.

For example, here are a few lines from the dictionary in {\tt
  2002FemPreg.dct}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
infile dictionary {
  _column(1)  str12  caseid    %12s  "RESPONDENT ID NUMBER"
  _column(13) byte   pregordr   %2f  "PREGNANCY ORDER (NUMBER)"
}
\end{verbatim}

This dictionary describes two variables: {\tt caseid} is a 12-character
string that represents the respondent ID; {\tt pregorder} is a 
one-byte integer that indicates which pregnancy this record
describes for this respondent.

The code you downloaded includes {\tt thinkstats2.py} which is a library
that contains many classes and functions used in this book.  {\tt
  thinkstats2.py} provides functions to read the Stata dictionary and
the NSFG data file.  Here's how it's used in {\tt nsfg.py}:

\begin{verbatim}
def ReadFemPreg(dct_file = '2002FemPreg.dct',
                dat_file = '2002FemPreg.dat.gz'):
    dct = thinkstats2.ReadStataDct(dct_file)
    df = dct.ReadFixedWidth(dat_file, compression='gzip')
    CleanFremPreg(df)
    return df
\end{verbatim}

{\tt thinkstats2.ReadStataDct} takes the name of the dictionary file
and returns a {\tt FixedWidthVariables} object, which contains the
information from the dictionary file and provides {\tt
  ReadFixedWidth}, which reads the data file.


\section{DataFrames}
\label{dataframe}

The result of {\tt ReadFixedWidth} is a DataFrame, which is the
fundamental data structure provided by pandas.  A DataFrame contains a
row for each record, in this case one row per pregnancy, and a column
for each variable.

In addition to the data, a DataFrame also contains the variable
names and their types, and it provides methods for accessing and modifying
the data.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import nsfg
>>> df = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()
>>> df
...
[13593 rows x 243 columns]
\end{verbatim}

If you print {\tt df} you get a truncated view of the rows and
columns, and the shape of the DataFrame, which is 13593
rows/records and 243 columns/variables.

The DataFrame attribute {\tt columns} returns a sequence of column
names:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df.columns
Index([u'caseid', u'pregordr', u'howpreg_n', u'howpreg_p', ... ])
\end{verbatim}

The result is an Index, which is another pandas data structure.  
We'll learn more about Index later, but for
now we'll treat it like a list:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df.columns[1]
'pregordr'
\end{verbatim}

To access a column from a DataFrame, you can use the variable
name as a key:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> pregordr = df['pregordr']
>>> type(pregordr)
<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
\end{verbatim}

The result is a Series, yet another pandas data structure.
A Series is like a Python list with some additional features.
When you print a Series, you get the indices and the
corresponding values:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> pregordr
0     1
1     2
2     1
3     2
...
13590    3
13591    4
13592    5
Name: pregordr, Length: 13593, dtype: int64
\end{verbatim}

The indices are the integers from 0 to 13593.  In this case
the elements are also integers.

The last line includes the variable name, Series length, and data type;
{\tt int64} is one of the types provided by NumPy.  If you run
this example on a 32-bit machine you might see {\tt int32}.

You can access the elements of a Series using integer indices
and slices:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> pregordr[0]
1
>>> pregordr[2:5]
2    1
3    2
4    3
Name: pregordr, dtype: int64
\end{verbatim}

The result of the index operator is an {\tt int64}; the
result of the slice is another Series.

You can also access the columns of a DataFrame using dot notation:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> pregordr = df.pregordr
\end{verbatim}

This notation only works if the column name is a valid Python
identifier, so it has to begin with a letter, can't contain spaces, etc.


\section{Variables}

We have already seen two variables in the NSFG dataset, {\tt caseid}
and {\tt pregordr}, and we have seen that there are 243 variables in
total.  For the explorations in this book, I'll use the following
variables:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt caseid} is the integer ID of the respondent.

\item {\tt prglength} is the integer duration of the pregnancy in weeks.

\item {\tt outcome} is an integer code for the outcome of the
  pregnancy.  The code 1 indicates a live birth.

\item {\tt pregordr} is a counter that indicates the order of
pregnancies for a respondent.

\item {\tt birthord} is a counter that indicates the order of live
  births for a respondent; for example, the code for a first child is
  1.  For outcomes other than live birth, this field is blank.

\item \verb"birthwgt_lb" and \verb"birthwgt_oz" contain the pounds and
  ounces parts of the birth weight of the baby.

\item {\tt agepreg} is the mother's age at the end of the pregnancy.

\item {\tt finalwgt} is the statistical weight associated with the
  respondent.  It is a floating-point value that indicates the number
  of people in the U.S. population this respondent represents.
  Members of oversampled groups have lower
  weights.\index{weight!sample}

\end{itemize}

If you read the codebook carefully, you will see that most of these
variables are {\bf recodes}, which means that they are not part of the
{\bf raw data} collected by the survey; they are calculated using
the raw data.  \index{recode} \index{raw data}

For example, {\tt prglength} for live births is equal to the raw
variable {\tt wksgest} (weeks of gestation) if it is available;
otherwise it is estimated using {\tt mosgest * 4.33} (months of
gestation times the average number of weeks in a month).

Recodes are often based on logic that checks the consistency and
accuracy of the data.  In general it is a good idea to use recodes
unless there is a compelling reason to process the raw data
yourself.


\section{Transformation}
\label{cleaning}

When you import data like this, you often have to check for errors,
deal with special values, convert data into different formats, and
perform calculations.  These operations are called {\bf data cleaning}.

{\tt nsfg.py} includes {\tt CleanFemPreg}, a function that cleans
the variables I am planning to use.

\begin{verbatim}
def CleanFemPreg(df):
    df.agepreg /= 100.0

    na_vals = [97, 98, 99]
    df.birthwgt_lb.replace(na_vals, np.nan, inplace=True)
    df.birthwgt_oz.replace(na_vals, np.nan, inplace=True)

    df['totalwgt_lb'] = df.birthwgt_lb + df.birthwgt_oz / 16.0    
\end{verbatim}

{\tt agepreg} contains the mother's age at the end of the
pregnancy.  In the data file, {\tt agepreg} is encoded as an integer
number of centiyears.  So the first line divides each element
of {\tt agepreg} by 100, yielding a floating-point value in
years.

\verb"birthwgt_lb" and \verb"birthwgt_oz" contain the weight of the
baby, in pounds and ounces, for pregnancies that end in live birth.
In addition it uses several special codes:

\begin{verbatim}
97	NOT ASCERTAINED
98	REFUSED	 
99	DON'T KNOW
\end{verbatim}

Special values encoded as numbers are {\em dangerous} because if they
are not handled properly, they can easily generate bogus results, like
a 99-pound baby.  The {\tt replace} method replaces these values with
{\tt NaN}, a special floating-point value that represents ``not a
number.''

As part of the IEEE floating-point standard, all mathematical
operations return {\tt nan} if either argument is {\tt nan}:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> np.nan / 100.0
nan
\end{verbatim}

So computations with {\tt nan} tend to do the right thing, and most
pandas functions handle {\tt nan} appropriately.  But dealing with
missing data will be a recurring issue.

The last line of {\tt CleanFemPreg} creates a new
column \verb"totalwgt_lb" that combines pounds and ounces into
a single quantity, in pounds.

One important note: when you add a new column to a DataFrame, you
must use dictionary syntax, like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    # CORRECT
    df['totalwgt_lb'] = df.birthwgt_lb + df.birthwgt_oz / 16.0 
\end{verbatim}

Not dot notation, like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    # WRONG!
    df.totalwgt_lb = df.birthwgt_lb + df.birthwgt_oz / 16.0 
\end{verbatim}

The version with dot notation adds an attribute to the DataFrame
object, but that attribute is not treated as a new column!


\section{Validation}

When data is exported from one software environment and imported into
another, errors might be introduced.  And when you are
getting familiar with a new dataset, you might interpret data
incorrectly or introduce other misunderstandings.  If you take
time to validate the data, you can save time later and avoid errors.

One way to validate data is to compute basic statistics and compare
them with published results.  For example, the NSFG codebook includes
tables that summarize each variable.  Here is the table for
{\tt outcome}, which encodes the outcome of each pregnancy:

\begin{verbatim}
value	label	 	        Total
1	LIVE BIRTH	 	9148
2	INDUCED ABORTION	1862
3	STILLBIRTH	 	 120
4	MISCARRIAGE	 	1921
5	ECTOPIC PREGNANCY	 190
6	CURRENT PREGNANCY	 352
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt Series} class provides the method \verb"value_counts", which
counts the number of times each value appears.  If we select the {\tt
  outcome} Series from the DataFrame, we can use \verb"value_counts"
to compare with the published data:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df.outcome.value_counts().sort_index()
1    9148
2    1862
3     120
4    1921
5     190
6     352
\end{verbatim}

The result of \verb"value_counts" is a Series;
\verb"sort_index" sorts the Series by index, so the
values appear in order.

Comparing the results with the published table, it looks like the
values in {\tt outcome} are correct.  Similarly, here is the published
table for \verb"birthwgt_lb"

\begin{verbatim}
value	label                  Total
.	INAPPLICABLE	 	4449
0-5	UNDER 6 POUNDS	 	1125
6	6 POUNDS	 	2223
7	7 POUNDS	 	3049
8	8 POUNDS	 	1889
9-95	9 POUNDS OR MORE	 799
\end{verbatim}

And here are the value counts:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df.birthwgt_lb.value_counts(sort=False)
0        8
1       40
2       53
3       98
4      229
5      697
6     2223
7     3049
8     1889
9      623
10     132
11      26
12      10
13       3
14       3
15       1
51       1
\end{verbatim}

The counts for 6, 7, and 8 pounds check out, and if you add
up the counts for 0-5 and 9-95, they check out, too.  But
if you look more closely, you notice one value that is almost
certainly an error, a 51 pound baby!

To deal with this error, I added a line to {\tt CleanFemPreg}:

\begin{verbatim}
df.birthwgt_lb[df.birthwgt_lb > 20] = np.nan
\end{verbatim}

This statement replaces invalid values with {\tt NaN}.
The expression in brackets yields a Series of type {\tt bool}, 
where True indicates that the condition is true.  When a boolean
Series is used as an index, it selects only the elements that
satisfy the condition; in this case, it replaces them with {\tt NaN}.


\section{Interpretation}

To work with data effectively, you have to think on two levels at the
same time: the level of statistics and the level of context.

As an example, let's look at the sequence of outcomes for a few
respondents.  Because of the way the data files are organized, we have
to do some processing to match up each pregnancy record with a respondent.
Here's a function that does that:

% TODO: clean this up by using caseid as the index

\begin{verbatim}
def MakePregMap(df):
    d = {}
    for index, caseid in df.caseid.iteritems():
        d.setdefault(caseid, []).append(index)
    return d
\end{verbatim}

{\tt df} is the DataFrame with pregnancy data.  The {\tt iteritems}
method creates an iterator that enumerates the index (row number)
and {\tt caseid} for each pregnancy.

{\tt d} is a dictionary that maps from each case ID to a list of
indices.  Using {\tt d} we can look up a respondent and get the
indices of that respondent's pregnancies.

This example looks up one respondent and prints a list of outcomes
for her pregnancies:

\begin{verbatim}
    caseid = 10229
    indices = preg_map[caseid]
    print(caseid, preg.outcome[indices].values)
\end{verbatim}

Using a list as an index into {\tt preg.outcome} selects the
indicated values and yields a Series.  Instead of printing the
whole Series, I selected the {\tt values} attribute, which is
a NumPy array.  The result looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
10229 [4 4 4 4 4 4 1]
\end{verbatim}

The outcome code {\tt 1} indicates a live birth. Code {\tt 4} indicates
a miscarriage; that is, a pregnancy that ended spontaneously, usually
with no known medical cause.

Statistically this respondent is not unusual.  Miscarriages are common
and there are other respondents who reported as many or more.

But remembering the context, this data tells the story of a woman who
was pregnant six times, each time ending in miscarriage.  Her seventh
and most recent pregnancy ended in a live birth.  If we consider this
data with empathy, it is natural to be moved by the story it tells.

Each record in the NSFG dataset represents a person who provided
honest answers to many personal and difficult questions.  We can use
this data to answer statistical questions about family life,
reproduction, and health.  At the same time, we have an obligation
to consider the people represented by the data, and to afford them
respect and gratitude.


\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
In the repository you downloaded, you should find a file named
\verb"chap01ex.ipynb", which is an iPython notebook.  You can
launch iPython notebook from the command line like this:

\begin{verbatim}
$ ipython notebook &
\end{verbatim}

If iPython is installed, it should launch a server that runs in the
background and open a browser to view the notebook.  If you are not
familiar with iPython, I suggest you start at
\url{http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html}.

Open \verb"chap01ex.ipynb".  Some cells are already filled in, and
you should execute them.  Other cells give you instructions for
exercises you should try.

A solution to this exercise is in \verb"chap01ex_soln.ipynb"
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
Create a file named \verb"chap01ex.py" and write code that reads
the respondent file, {\tt 2002FemResp.dat.gz}.  You might want to
start with a copy of {\tt nsfg.py} and modify it.

The variable {\tt pregnum} is a recode that indicates how many
times each respondent has been pregnant.  Print the value counts
for this variable and compare them to the published results in
the NSFG codebook.

You can also cross-validate the respondent and pregnancy files by
comparing {\tt pregnum} for each respondent with the number of
records in the pregnancy file.

You can use {\tt nsfg.MakePregMap} to make a dictionary that maps
from each {\tt caseid} to a list of indices into the pregnancy
DataFrame.

Similarly, you might want to make a dictionary that maps from each
{\tt caseid} to an index into the respondent DataFrame.

A solution to this exercise is in \verb"chap01ex_soln.py"
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
The best way to learn about data science is to work on a project you are
interested in.  Is there a question like, ``Do first babies arrive
late,'' that you want to investigate?

Think about questions you find personally interesting, or items of
conventional wisdom, or controversial topics, or questions that have
political consequences, and see if you can formulate a question that
lends itself to statistical inquiry.

Look for data to help you address the question.  Governments are good
sources because data from public research is often freely
available.  Good places to start include \url{http://www.data.gov/},
and \url{http://www.science.gov/}, and in the United Kingdom,
\url{http://data.gov.uk/}.

Two of my favorite data sets are the General Social Survey at
\url{http://www3.norc.org/gss+website/}, and the European Social
Survey at \url{http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/}.

If it seems like someone has already answered your question, look
closely to see whether the answer is justified.  There might be flaws
in the data or the analysis that make the conclusion unreliable.  In
that case you could perform a different analysis of the same data, or
look for a better source of data.

If you find a published paper that addresses your question, you
should be able to get the raw data.  Many authors make their data
available on the web, but for sensitive data you might have to
write to the authors, provide information about how you plan to use
the data, or agree to certain terms of use.  Be persistent!

\chapter{Distributions}
\label{descriptive}


\section{Histograms}
\label{histograms}

One of the best ways to describe a variable is to report the values
that appear in the dataset and how many times each value appears.
This description is called the {\bf distribution} of the variable.
\index{distribution}

The most common representation of a distribution is a {\bf histogram},
which is a graph that shows the {\bf frequency} of each value.  In
this context, ``frequency'' means the number of times the value
appears.  \index{histogram} \index{frequency}
\index{dictionary}

In Python, an efficient way to compute frequencies is with a
dictionary.  Given a sequence of values, {\tt t}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
hist = {}
for x in t:
    hist[x] = hist.get(x, 0) + 1
\end{verbatim}

The result is a dictionary that maps from values to frequencies.
Alternatively, you could use the {\tt Counter} class defined in the
{\tt collections} module:

\begin{verbatim}
from collections import Counter
counter = Counter(t)
\end{verbatim}

The result is a {\tt Counter} object, which is a subclass of
dictionary.  For details, see
\url{https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter}.

Or in pandas, we can use the
Series method \verb"value_counts", which we saw in the previous
chapter.


\section{Representing histograms}
\index{histogram}
\index{Hist object}

The Python module that accompanies this book, {\tt thinkstats2.py},
provides a class named Hist, which represents a histogram.  You can
read the documentation at {\tt http://thinkstats2.com/thinkstats2.html}.

The {\tt Hist} constructor can take a sequence, dictionary, pandas
Series, or another Hist.  You can test it in Python's interactive
mode:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> import thinkstats2
>>> hist = thinkstats2.Hist([1, 2, 2, 3, 5])
\end{verbatim}

Hist objects provide the method {\tt Freq}, which takes a value and
returns its frequency:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> hist.Freq(2)
2
\end{verbatim}

If you look up a value that has never appeared, the frequency is 0.
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> hist.Freq(4)
0
\end{verbatim}

{\tt Values} returns an unsorted list of the values in the Hist:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> hist.Values()
[1, 5, 3, 2]
\end{verbatim}

To loop through the values in order, you can use the built-in function
{\tt sorted}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
for val in sorted(hist.Values()):
    print(val, hist.Freq(val))
\end{verbatim}

If you are planning to look up all of the frequencies, it is more
efficient to use {\tt Items}, which returns an unsorted list of
value-frequency pairs:
%
\begin{verbatim}
for val, freq in hist.Items():
     print(val, freq)
\end{verbatim}


\section{Plotting histograms}
\index{plotting}
\index{{\tt pyplot}}

\begin{figure}
% first.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/first_wgt_lb_hist.pdf}}
\caption{Histogram of the pound part of birth weight.}
\label{first_wgt_lb_hist}
\end{figure}

There are a number of Python packages for making figures and graphs.
One of the most popular is {\tt pyplot}, which is part of
the {\tt matplotlib} package (see \url{http://matplotlib.org}).

This package is included in many Python installations.  To see whether
you have it, launch the Python interpreter and run:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
>>> pyplot.pie([1,2,3])
>>> pyplot.show()
\end{verbatim}

If you have {\tt matplotlib} you should see a simple pie chart;
otherwise you will have to install it.
\index{matplotlib}
\index{bar plot}
\index{plot!bar}

Histograms are most often plotted as bar charts.  The
{\tt pyplot} function to draw a bar chart is {\tt bar}.  Hist
objects provide a method called {\tt Render} that returns a sorted
list of values and a list of the corresponding frequencies, which
is the format {\tt bar} expects:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> vals, freqs = hist.Render()
>>> rectangles = pyplot.bar(vals, freqs)
>>> pyplot.show()
\end{verbatim}

The code that accompanies this book includes {\tt thinkplot.py}, which
provides functions for plotting histograms and other objects we will
see soon.  You can read the documentation at {\tt
  http://thinkstats2.com/thinkplot.html}.  \index{{\tt thinkplot.py}}

To plot the same histogram with {\tt thinkplot.py}, try this:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import thinkplot
>>> thinkplot.Hist(hist)
>>> thinkplot.Show(xlabel='value', ylabel='frequency')
\end{verbatim}

Most of the functions in {\tt thinkplot.py} are wrappers for
functions in {\tt matplotlib}, customized to work with
the objects defined in {\tt thinkstats2.py}.

\begin{figure}
% first.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/first_wgt_oz_hist.pdf}}
\caption{Histogram of the ounce part of birth weight.}
\label{first_wgt_oz_hist}
\end{figure}


\section{NSFG variables}

Now let's get back to the data from the NSFG.  The code in this
chapter is from {\tt first.py}.  
For information about downloading and
working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.

% TODO: apparently I can't refer to a label in the preface?

When you start working with a new dataset, I suggest you explore
the variables you are planning to use one at a time, and a good
way to start is by looking at histograms.
\index{histograms}

In Section~\ref{cleaning} we transformed {\tt agepreg}
from centiyears to years, and combined \verb"birthwgt_lb" and
\verb"birthwgt_oz" into a single quantity, \verb"totalwgt_lb".
In this section I'll use these variables to demonstrate some
features of histograms.

\begin{figure}
% first.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/first_agepreg_hist.pdf}}
\caption{Histogram of mother's age at end of pregnancy.}
\label{first_agepreg_hist}
\end{figure}

I'll start by reading the data and selecting records for live
births:

\begin{verbatim}
    preg = nsfg.ReadFemPreg()
    live = preg[preg.outcome == 1]
\end{verbatim}

The expression in brackets is a boolean Series that
selects rows from the DataFrame and returns a new DataFrame.
Next I'll generate and plot the histogram of
\verb"birthwgt_lb" for live births (this code is in {\tt first.py}).

\begin{verbatim}
    hist = thinkstats2.Hist(live.birthwgt_lb, label='birthwgt_lb')
    thinkplot.Hist(hist)
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='weeks', ylabel='frequency')
\end{verbatim}

When the argument passed to {\tt Hist} is a pandas Series, any
{\tt NaN} values are dropped.  {\tt label} is a string that appears
in the legend when the Hist is plotted.

\begin{figure}
% first.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/first_prglngth_hist.pdf}}
\caption{Histogram of pregnancy length in weeks.}
\label{first_prglngth_hist}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{first_wgt_lb_hist} shows the result.  The most common
value, called the {\bf mode}, is 7 pounds.  The distribution is
approximately bell-shaped, which is the shape of the {\bf Gaussian} or
distribution, also called a {\bf normal} distribution.  But unlike a
true Gaussian distribution, this distribution is asymmetric; it has
a {\bf tail} that extends farther to the left than to the right.

Figure~\ref{first_wgt_oz_hist} shows the histogram of
\verb"birthwgt_oz", which is the ounces part of birth weight.  In
theory we expect this distribution to be {\bf uniform}; that is, all
values should have the same frequency.  In fact, 0 is more common than
the other values, and 1 and 15 are less common, probably because
respondents round off birth weights that are close to an integer
value.

Figure~\ref{first_agepreg_hist} shows the histogram of \verb"agepreg",
the mother's age at the end of pregnancy.  The mode is 21 years.  The
distribution is very roughly bell-shaped, but in this case the tail
extends farther to the right than left, because of biological limits.

Figure~\ref{first_prglngth_hist} shows the histogram of \verb"prglngth",
the length of the pregnancy in weeks.  By far the most common value
is 39 weeks.  The left tail is longer than the right, again for
biological reasons; premature babies are common, but pregnancies seldom
go past 43 weeks, and doctors often intervene if they do. 


\section{Outliers}

Looking at histograms, it is easy to identify the most common
values and the shape of the distribution, but rare values are
not always visible.

Before going on, it is a good idea to check for {\bf
  outliers}, which are extreme values that might be errors in
measurement and recording, or might be accurate measurements of rare
events.

Hist provides method {\tt Largest} and {\tt Smallest}, which take
an integer {\tt n} and return the {\tt n} largest or smallest
values from the histogram with their frequencies:

\begin{verbatim}
    for weeks, freq in hist.Smallest(10):
        print(weeks, freq)
\end{verbatim}

In the list of pregnancy lengths for live births, the 10 lowest values
are {\tt [0, 4, 9, 13, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]}.  Values below 10 weeks
are certainly errors; the most likely explanation is that the outcome
was not coded correctly.  Values higher than 30 weeks are probably
legitimate.  Between 10 and 30 weeks, it is hard to be sure; some
values are probably errors, but some represent premature babies.

On the other end of the range, the highest values are:
%
\begin{verbatim}
weeks  count
43     148
44     46
45     10
46     1
47     1
48     7
50     2
\end{verbatim}

Most doctors recommend induced labor if a pregnancy exceeds 42 weeks,
so some of the longer values are surprising.  In particular, 50 weeks
seems medically unlikely.

The best way to handle outliers depends on ``domain knowledge'';
that is, information about where the data come from and what they
mean.  And it depends on what analysis you are planning to perform.

In this example, the motivating question is whether first babies
tend to be early (or late).  When people ask this question, they are
usually interested in full-term pregnancies, so for this analysis
I will focus on pregnancies longer than 27 weeks.


\section{First babies}

Now we can compare the distribution of pregnancy lengths for first
babies and others.  I divided the DataFrame of live births using
{\tt birthord}, and computed their histograms:

\begin{verbatim}
    firsts = live[live.birthord == 1]
    others = live[live.birthord != 1]

    first_hist = thinkstats2.Hist(firsts.prglngth)
    other_hist = thinkstats2.Hist(others.prglngth)
\end{verbatim}

Then I plotted their histograms on the same axis:

\begin{verbatim}
    width = 0.45
    thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
    thinkplot.Hist(first_hist, align='right', width=width)
    thinkplot.Hist(other_hist, align='left', width=width)
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='weeks', ylabel='frequency')
\end{verbatim}

{\tt thinkplot.PrePlot} takes as an argument the number of histograms
we are planning to plot; it uses this information to choose
an appropriate collection of colors.

\begin{figure}
% first.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/first_nsfg_hist.pdf}}
\caption{Histogram of pregnancy lengths.}
\label{first_nsfg_hist}
\end{figure}

{\tt thinkplot.Hist} normally uses {\tt align='center'} so that
each bar is centered over its value.  For this figure, I use
{\tt align='right'} and {\tt align='left'} to place
corresponding bars on either side of the value.

With {\tt width=0.45}, the total width of the two bars is 0.9,
leaving some space between each pair.

Finally, I adjusted the axis to show only data between 27 and 46 weeks.
Figure~\ref{first_nsfg_hist} shows the result.
\index{pregnancy length}
\index{length!pregnancy}

Histograms are useful because they make the most frequent values
immediately apparent.  But they are not the best choice for comparing
two distributions.  In this example, there are fewer ``first babies''
than ``others,'' so some of the apparent differences in the histograms
are due to sample sizes.  In the next chapter we address this problem
using probability mass functions.


\section{Summarizing distributions}
\label{mean}

A histogram is a complete description of the distribution of a sample;
that is, given a histogram, we could reconstruct the values in the
sample (although not their order).

If the details of the distribution are important, it might be
necessary to present a histogram.  But often we want to
summarize the distribution with a few descriptive statistics.

Some of the characteristics we might want to report are:

\begin{description}

\item[central tendency]: Do the values tend to cluster around
a particular point?
\index{central tendency}

\item[modes]: Is there more that one cluster?
\index{mode}

\item[spread]: How much variability is there in the values?
\index{spread}

\item[tails]: How quickly do the probabilities drop off as we
move away from the modes?
\index{tail}

\item[outliers]: Are there extreme values far from the modes?
\index{outlier}

\end{description}

Statistics designed to answer these questions are called {\bf summary
  statistics}.  By far the most common summary statistic is the {\bf
  mean}, which is meant to describe the central tendency of the
distribution.  \index{mean} \index{average} \index{summary statistics}

If you have a sample of {\tt n} values, $x_i$, the mean, $\xbar$, is
the sum of the values divided by the number of values; in other words
%
\[ \xbar = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i x_i \]
%
The words ``mean'' and ``average'' are sometimes used interchangeably,
but I will maintain this distinction:

\begin{itemize}

\item The ``mean'' of a sample is the summary statistic computed with
  the previous formula.

\item An ``average'' is one of several summary statistics you might
  choose to describe a central tendency.
\index{central tendency}

\end{itemize}

Sometimes the mean is a good description of a set of values.  For
example, apples are all pretty much the same size (at least the ones
sold in supermarkets).  So if I buy 6 apples and the total weight is 3
pounds, it would be a reasonable summary to say they are about a half
pound each.
\index{weight!pumpkin}

But pumpkins are more diverse.  Suppose I grow several varieties in my
garden, and one day I harvest three decorative pumpkins that are 1
pound each, two pie pumpkins that are 3 pounds each, and one Atlantic
Giant\textregistered~pumpkin that weighs 591 pounds.  The mean of this
sample is 100 pounds, but if I told you ``The average pumpkin in my
garden is 100 pounds,'' that would be misleading.  In this example,
there is no meaningful average because there is no typical pumpkin.
\index{pumpkin}



\section{Variance}
\index{variance}

If there is no single number that summarizes pumpkin weights,
we can do a little better with two numbers: mean and {\bf variance}.

Variance is a summary statistic intended to describe the variability
or spread of a distribution.  The variance of a set of values is
%
\[ S^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i (x_i - \xbar)^2 \]
%
The term $x_i - \xbar$ is called the ``deviation from the mean,'' so
variance is the mean squared deviation, which is why it is denoted
with exponent 2.  The square root of variance, $S$, is the
{\bf standard deviation}.  \index{deviation} \index{standard
  deviation}

If you have prior experience, you might have seen a formula for
variance with $n-1$ in the denominator, rather than {\tt n}.  This
statistic is used to estimate the variance in a population using a
sample.  We will come back to this in Chapter~\ref{estimation}.
\index{sample variance}

Pandas data structures provides methods to compute mean, variance and
standard deviation:

\begin{verbatim}
    mean = live.prglngth.mean()
    var = live.prglngth.var()
    std = live.prglngth.std()
\end{verbatim}

For all live births, the mean pregnancy length is 38.6 weeks, the
standard deviation is 2.7 weeks, which means we should expect
deviations of 2-3 weeks to be common.

Variance is 7.3, which is hard to interpret, especially since the
units are weeks$^2$, or ``square weeks,'' whatever that means.
Variance is useful in some calculations we'll see later, but it is not
a good summary statistic.


\section{Effect size}
\index{effect size}

An {\bf effect size} is a summary statistic intended describe (wait
for it) the size of an effect.  For example, to describe the
difference between two groups, one obvious choice is the difference in
the means.  \index{effect size}

For example, the mean pregnancy length for first babies is 38.601; for
other babies it is 38.523.  The difference is 0.078 weeks, which works
out to 13 hours.  As a fraction of the typical pregnancy length, this
difference is about 0.2\%.

If we assume that this estimate is accurate, such a difference
would have no practical consequences.  In fact, without
observing a large number of pregnancies, it is unlikely that anyone
would notice this difference at all.

Another way to convey the size of the effect is to compare the
difference between groups to the variability within groups.
Cohen's $d$ is a statistic intended to do that; it is defined:
%
\[ d = \frac{\bar{x_1} - \bar{x_2}}{s}  \]
%
where $\bar{x_1}$ and $\bar{x_2}$ are the means of the groups and
$s$ is the ``pooled standard deviation'', which is a weighted sum of
the standard deviations within groups.  Here's what it looks like in
Python:

\begin{verbatim}
def CohenEffectSize(group1, group2):
    diff = group1.mean() - group2.mean()

    var1 = group1.var()
    var2 = group2.var()
    n1, n2 = len(group1), len(group2)

    pooled_var = (n1 * var1 + n2 * var2) / (n1 + n2)
    d = diff / math.sqrt(pooled_var)
    return d
\end{verbatim}

In this example, the difference in means is 0.029 standard deviations.
To put that in perspective, the difference in height between men and
women is about 1.7 standard deviations (see
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size}).


\section{Reporting results}

We have seen several ways to describe the difference in pregnancy
length (if there is one) between first babies and others.  How should
we report these results?

The answer depends on who is asking the question.  A scientist might
be interested in any (real) effect, no matter how small.  A doctor
might only care about effects that are {\bf clinically significant};
that is, differences that affect treatment decisions.  A pregnant
woman might be interested in results that are relevant to her, like
the probability of delivering early or late.  \index{clinically
  significant} \index{significance}

How you report results also depends on your goals.  If you are trying
to demonstrate the importance of an effect, you might choose summary
statistics that emphasize differences.  If you are trying to reassure
a patient, you might choose statistics that put the differences in
context.

Of course your decisions should also be guided by professional ethics.
It's ok to be persuasive; you {\em should} design statistical reports
and visualizations that tell a story clearly.  But you should also do
your best to make your reports honest, and to acknowledge uncertainty
and limitations.


\section{Exercises}

Based on the results in this chapter, suppose you were asked to

\chapter{Probability mass functions}
\index{Probability mass function}

\section{Pmfs}
\index{Pmf object}
\index{{\tt pmf.py}@{\tt Pmf.py}}

Another way to represent a distribution is a {\bf probability mass
  function} (PMF), which maps from each value to its probability.  A
{\bf probability} is a frequency expressed as a fraction of the sample
size, {\tt n}.  To get from frequencies to probabilities, we divide
through by {\tt n}, which is called {\bf normalization}.
\index{probability}
\index{normalization}
\index{PMF}
\index{probability mass function}

Given a Hist, we can make a dictionary that maps from each
value to its probability:
%
\begin{verbatim}
n = hist.Total()
d = {}
for x, freq in hist.Items():
    d[x] = freq / n
\end{verbatim}
%
Or we can use the {\tt Pmf} class provided by {\tt thinkstats2.py}.
Like {\tt Hist}, the {\tt Pmf} constructor can take a list, pandas
Series, dictionary, Hist, or another Pmf object.  Here's an example
with a simple list.
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> import thinkstats2
>>> pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf([1, 2, 2, 3, 5])
\end{verbatim}

The result is normalized so the total probability is 1.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> pmf.Total()
1.0
\end{verbatim}

Pmf and Hist objects are similar in many ways; in fact, they inherit
many of their methods from a common parent class.  For example, the
methods {\tt Values} and {\tt Items} work the same way for both.  The
biggest difference is that a Hist maps from values to integer
counters; a Pmf maps from values to floating-point probabilities.

To look up the probability associated with a value, use {\tt Prob}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> pmf.Prob(2)
0.4
\end{verbatim}

You can modify an existing Pmf by incrementing the probability
associated with a value:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> pmf.Incr(2, 0.2)
>>> pmf.Prob(2)
0.6
\end{verbatim}

Or you can multiply a probability by a factor:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> pmf.Mult(2, 0.5)
>>> pmf.Prob(2)
0.3
\end{verbatim}

If you modify a Pmf, the result may not be normalized; that is, the
probabilities may no longer add up to 1.  To check, you can call {\tt
  Total}, which returns the sum of the probabilities:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> pmf.Total()
0.9
\end{verbatim}

To renormalize, call {\tt Normalize}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
>>> pmf.Normalize()
>>> pmf.Total()
1.0
\end{verbatim}

Pmf objects provide a {\tt Copy} method so you can make
and modify a copy without affecting the original.

My notation for PMFs can be confusing, so here it is: I use Pmf
for the name of the class, {\tt pmf} as a variable name, and ``PMF''
to refer to the mathematical concept of a probability mass function.


\section{Plotting PMFs}
\index{plotting}
\index{PMF}

There are two common ways to plot Pmfs:

\begin{itemize}

\item To plot a Pmf as a bar graph, you can use 
{\tt thinkplot.Hist}.  Bar graphs are most useful if the number
of values in the Pmf is small.
\index{bar plot}
\index{plot!bar}

\item To plot a Pmf as a step function, you can use
{\tt thinkplot.Pmf}.  This option is most useful if there are
a large number of values and the Pmf is smooth.  This function
also works with Hist objects.
\index{line plot}
\index{plot!line}

\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
% probability.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=3.0in]{figs/probability_nsfg_pmf.pdf}}
\caption{PMF of pregnancy lengths for first babies and others, using
  bar graphs and step functions.}
\label{probability_nsfg_pmf}
\end{figure}
\index{pregnancy length}
\index{length!pregnancy}

Figure~\ref{probability_nsfg_pmf} shows PMFs of pregnancy length for
first babies and others using bar graphs (left) and step functions
(right).

By plotting the PMF instead of the histogram, we can compare the two
distributions without distortion caused by the difference in sample
size.  Based on this figure, first babies seem to be less likely than
others to arrive on time (week 39) and more likely to be a late (weeks
41 and 42).

Whether you plot PMFs as bar graphs or step functions, I'll leave
that up to you.
The code that generates this figure is in {\tt probability.py}.
Note: {\tt pyplot} provides a function called {\tt hist} that
takes a sequence of values, computes the histogram and plots it.
Since I use {\tt Hist} objects, I usually don't use {\tt pyplot.hist}.

The code that generates Figure~\ref{probability_nsfg_pmf} is in
{\tt probability.py}:

\begin{verbatim}
    thinkplot.PrePlot(2, cols=2)
    thinkplot.Hist(first_pmf, align='right', width=width)
    thinkplot.Hist(other_pmf, align='left', width=width)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='weeks',
                     ylabel='probability',
                     axis=[27, 46, 0, 0.6])

    thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
    thinkplot.SubPlot(2)
    thinkplot.Pmfs([first_pmf, other_pmf])
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='weeks',
                   axis=[27, 46, 0, 0.6])
\end{verbatim}

{\tt PrePlot} takes optional parameters {\tt rows} and {\tt cols}
to make a grid of figures, in this case 1 row of 2 figures.
The first figure (on the left) displays the Pmfs using {\tt Hist},
as we have seen before.

The second call to {\tt PrePlot} resets the color generator.  Then
{\tt SubPlot} switches to the second figure (on the right) and
displays the Pmfs using {\tt Pmf}.  I used the {\tt axis} option
to ensure that the two figures are on the same axes, which is
generally a good idea if you intend to compare two figures.


\section{Other visualizations}
\label{visualization}

Histograms and PMFs are useful while you are exploring data and
trying to identify patterns and relationships.
Once you have an idea what is going on, a good next step is to
design a visualization that makes the patterns your have identified
as clear as possible.
\index{exploratory data analysis}
\index{visualization}

In the NSFG data, the biggest differences in the distributions are
near the mode.  So it makes sense to zoom in on that part of the
graph, and to transform the data to emphasize differences:
\index{National Survey of Family Growth}
\index{NSFG}

\begin{verbatim}
    weeks = range(35, 46)
    diffs = []
    for week in weeks:
        p1 = first_pmf.Prob(week)
        p2 = other_pmf.Prob(week)
        diff = 100 * (p1 - p2)
        diffs.append(diff)

    thinkplot.Bar(weeks, diffs)
\end{verbatim}

In this code, {\tt weeks} is the range of weeks; {\tt diffs} is the
difference between the two PMFs in percentage points.
Figure~\ref{probability_nsfg_diffs} shows the result.  This figure
makes the pattern clearer: first babies are less likely to be born in
week 39, and somewhat more likely to be born in weeks 41 and 42.

\begin{figure}
% probability.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/probability_nsfg_diffs.pdf}}
\caption{Difference, in percentage points, by week.}
\label{probability_nsfg_diffs}
\end{figure}

For now we should hold this conclusion only tentatively.
We used the same dataset to identify an
apparent difference and then chose a visualization that makes the
difference apparent.  We can't be sure this effect is real;
it might be due to random variation.  We'll address this concern
later.


\section{The class size paradox}
\index{class size}

Before we go on, I want to look at an example that demonstrates
one kind of computation you can do with Pmf objects: I call
this example the ``class size paradox.''

At many American colleges and universities, the student-to-faculty
ratio is about 10:1.  But students are often surprised to discover
that their average class size is bigger than 10.  There
are two reasons for the discrepancy:

\begin{itemize}

\item Students typically take 4--5 classes per semester, but
professors often teach 1 or 2.

\item The number of students who enjoy a small class is small,
but the number of students in a large class is (ahem!) large.

\end{itemize}

The first effect is obvious (at least once it is pointed out);
the second is more subtle.  Let's look at an example.  Suppose
that a college offers 65 classes in a given semester, with the
following distribution of sizes:
%
\begin{verbatim}
 size      count
 5- 9          8
10-14          8
15-19         14
20-24          4
25-29          6
30-34         12
35-39          8
40-44          3
45-49          2
\end{verbatim}

If you ask the Dean for the average class size, he would
construct a PMF, compute the mean, and report that the
average class size is 23.7.  Here's the code:

\begin{verbatim}
    d = { 7: 8, 12: 8, 17: 14, 22: 4, 
          27: 6, 32: 12, 37: 8, 42: 3, 47: 2 }

    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(d, label='actual')
    print('mean', pmf.Mean())
\end{verbatim}

But if you survey a group of students, ask them how many
students are in their classes, and compute the mean, you would
think the average class was bigger.  Let's see how
much bigger.

First, I'll compute the
distribution as observed by students, where the probability
associated with each class size is ``biased'' by the number
of students in the class.

\begin{verbatim}
def BiasPmf(pmf, label):
    new_pmf = pmf.Copy(label=label)

    for x, p in pmf.Items():
        new_pmf.Mult(x, x)
        
    new_pmf.Normalize()
    return new_pmf
\end{verbatim}

For each class size, {\tt x}, we multiply the probability by
{\tt x}, the number of students who observe that class size.
The result is a new Pmf that represents the biased distribution.

Now we can plot the actual and observed distributions:

\begin{verbatim}
    biased_pmf = BiasPmf(pmf, label='observed')
    thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
    thinkplot.Pmfs([pmf, biased_pmf])
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='class size', ylabel='PMF')
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
% probability.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=3.0in]{figs/class_size1.pdf}}
\caption{Distribution of class sizes, actual and as observed by students.}
\label{class_size1}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{class_size1} shows the result.  In the biased distribution
there are fewer small classes and more large ones.
The mean of the biased distribution is 29.1, almost 25\% higher
than the actual mean.

It is also possible to invert this operation.  Suppose you want to
find the distribution of class sizes at a college, but you can't get
reliable data from the Dean.  An alternative is to choose a random
sample of students and how many students are in their
classes.  \index{bias!oversampling} \index{oversampling}

The result would be biased for the reasons we've just seen, but you
can use it to estimate the actual distribution.  Here's the function
that unbiases a Pmf:

\begin{verbatim}
def UnbiasPmf(pmf, label):
    new_pmf = pmf.Copy(label=label)

    for x, p in pmf.Items():
        new_pmf.Mult(x, 1.0/x)
        
    new_pmf.Normalize()
    return new_pmf
\end{verbatim}

It's similar to {\tt BiasPmf}; the only difference is that it
divides each probability by {\tt x} instead of multiplying.

The code for this example is in \url{chap03.py}.  It confirms that
if we start with the actual distribution, apply {\tt BiasPmf}
and apply {\tt UnbiasPmf} to the result, we get the original
distribution back.


\section{DataFrame indexing}

In Section~\ref{dataframe} we read a pandas DataFrame and used it to
select and modify data columns.  Now let's look at row selection.
To start, I'll create a numpy array of random numbers and use it
to initialize a DataFrame:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import pandas
>>> array = np.random.randn(4, 2)
>>> pandas.DataFrame(array)
          0         1
0 -0.143510  0.616050
1 -1.489647  0.300774
2 -0.074350  0.039621
3 -1.369968  0.545897
\end{verbatim}

By default, the rows and columns are numbered starting at zero, but
you can provide column names:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> columns = ['A', 'B']
>>> pandas.DataFrame(array, columns=columns)
          A         B
0 -0.143510  0.616050
1 -1.489647  0.300774
2 -0.074350  0.039621
3 -1.369968  0.545897
\end{verbatim}

You can also provide row names.  The set of row names is called the
index; the row names themselves are called labels.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> index = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
>>> pandas.DataFrame(array, columns=columns, index=index)
          A         B
a -0.143510  0.616050
b -1.489647  0.300774
c -0.074350  0.039621
d -1.369968  0.545897
\end{verbatim}

As we saw in the previous chapter, simple indexing selects a
column, returning a Series:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df['A']
a   -0.143510
b   -1.489647
c   -0.074350
d   -1.369968
Name: A, dtype: float64
\end{verbatim}

To select a row by label, you can use the {\tt loc} attribute, which
returns a Series:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df.loc['a']
A   -0.14351
B    0.61605
Name: a, dtype: float64
\end{verbatim}

If you know the integer position of a row, rather than its label, you
can use the {\tt iloc} attribute, which also returns a Series.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df.iloc[0]
A   -0.14351
B    0.61605
Name: a, dtype: float64
\end{verbatim}

{\tt loc} can also take a list of labels, and {\tt iloc} can take a list 
of integer positions.  The result is a DataFrame.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> indices = ['a', 'c']
>>> df.loc[indices]
         A         B
a -0.14351  0.616050
c -0.07435  0.039621
\end{verbatim}

Finally, you can use a slice to select a range of rows by label:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df['a':'c']
          A         B
a -0.143510  0.616050
b -1.489647  0.300774
c -0.074350  0.039621
\end{verbatim}

Or by integer position:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> df[0:2]
          A         B
a -0.143510  0.616050
b -1.489647  0.300774
\end{verbatim}

The result in either case is a DataFrame, but notice that the first
result includes the end of the slice; the second doesn't.

My advice: if your rows have labels that are not simple integers, use
the labels consistently and avoid using integer positions.



\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}
Something like the class size paradox appears if you survey children
and ask how many children are in their family.  Families with many
children are more likely to appear in your sample, and
families with no children have no chance to be in the sample.

Use the NSFG respondent variable \verb"NUMKDHH" to construct the actual
distribution for the number of children under 18 in the household.

Now compute the biased distribution we would see if we surveyed the
children and asked them how many children under 18 (including themselves)
are in their household.  

Plot the actual and biased distributions, and compute their means.
As a starting place, you can use \verb"chap03ex.ipynb"
You can find a solution in \verb"chap03ex_soln.ipynb".
\end{exercise}


For the following exercises, create a file named {\tt chap03ex.py}.
You can find a solution in \verb"chap03ex_soln.py".

\begin{exercise}
%
\index{mean}
\index{variance}
\index{PMF}
%
In Section~\ref{mean} we computed the mean of a sample by adding up
the elements and dividing by n.  If you are given a PMF, you can
still compute the mean, but the process is slightly different:
%
\[ \xbar = \sum_i p_i x_i \]
%
where the $x_i$ are the unique values in the PMF and $p_i=PMF(x_i)$.
Similarly, you can compute variance like this:
%
\[ S^2 = \sum_i p_i (x_i - \xbar)^2\]
% 
Write functions called {\tt PmfMean} and {\tt PmfVar} that take a
Pmf object and compute the mean and variance.  To test these methods,
check that they are consistent with the methods {\tt Mean} and {\tt
  Var} provided by {\tt Pmf}.
\index{{\tt pmf.py}@{\tt Pmf.py}}
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
I started with the question, ``Are first babies more likely
to be late?''  To address it, I computed the difference in
means between groups of babies, but I ignored the possibility
that there might be a difference between first babies and
others {\em for the same woman}.

To address this version of the question, select respondents who
have at least two babies and compute pairwise differences.  Does
this formulation of the question yield a different result?

Hint: use {\tt nsfg.MakePregMap}.
\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{relay}

In most foot races, everyone starts at the same time.  If you are a
fast runner, you usually pass a lot of people at the beginning of the
race, but after a few miles everyone around you is going at the same
speed.
\index{relay race}
\index{bias!oversampling}
\index{oversampling}

When I ran a long-distance (209 miles) relay race for the first
time, I noticed an odd phenomenon: when I overtook another runner, I
was usually much faster, and when another runner overtook me, he was
usually much faster.

At first I thought that the distribution of speeds might be bimodal;
that is, there were many slow runners and many fast runners, but few
at my speed.

Then I realized that I was the victim a bias similar to the
effect of class size.  The race
was unusual in two ways: it used a staggered start, so teams started
at different times; also, many teams included runners at different
levels of ability. \index{bias!selection} \index{selection bias}

As a result, runners were spread out along the course with little
relationship between speed and location.  When I started running my
leg, the runners near me were (pretty much) a random sample of the
runners in the race.

So where does the bias come from?  During my time on the course, the
chance of overtaking a runner, or being overtaken, is proportional to
the difference in our speeds.  To see why, think about the extremes.
If another runner is going at the same speed as me, neither of us will
overtake the other.  If someone is going so fast that they cover the
entire course while I am running, they are certain to overtake me.

Write a function called {\tt ObservedPmf} that takes a Pmf representing
the actual distribution of runners' speeds, and the speed of a running
observer, and returns a new Pmf representing the distribution of
runners' speeds as seen by the observer.

To test your function, you can use {\tt relay.py}, which  reads the
results from the James Joyce Ramble 10K in Dedham MA and converts the
pace of each runner to mph.

Compute the distribution of speeds you would observe if you ran a
relay race at 7.5 mph with this group of runners.  A solution to this
exercise is in \url{http://thinkstats2.com/relay_soln.py}

\chapter{Cumulative distribution functions}
\label{cumulative}


\section{The limits of PMFs}
\index{PMF}

PMFs work well if the number of values is small.  But as the number of
values increases, the probability associated with each value gets
smaller and the effect of random noise increases.

For example, we might be interested in the distribution of birth
weights.  In the NSFG data, the variable \verb"totalwgt_lb" records
weight at birth in pounds.  Figure~\ref{nsfg_birthwgt_pmf} shows
the PMF of these values for first babies and others.  \index{National
  Survey of Family Growth} \index{NSFG} \index{birth weight}
\index{weight!birth}

\begin{figure}
% cumulative.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/nsfg_birthwgt_pmf.pdf}}
\caption{PMF of birth weights.  This figure shows a limitation
of PMFs: they are hard to compare.}
\label{nsfg_birthwgt_pmf}
\end{figure}

Overall, these distributions resemble the bell shape of a Gaussian
distribution, with many values near the mean and a few values much
higher and lower.

But parts of this figure are hard to interpret.  There are many spikes
and valleys, and some apparent differences between the distributions.
It is hard to tell which of these features are meaningful.  Also, it
is hard to see overall patterns; for example, which distribution do
you think has the higher mean?
\index{binning}

These problems can be mitigated by binning the data; that is, dividing
the range of values into non-overlapping intervals and counting the
number of values in each bin.  Binning can be useful, but it is tricky
to get the size of the bins right.  If they are big enough to smooth
out noise, they might also smooth out useful information.

An alternative that avoids these problems is the cumulative
distribution function (CDF), which is the subject of this chapter.
But before I can explain CDFs, I have to explain percentiles.


\section{Percentiles}
\index{percentile rank}

If you have taken a standardized test, you probably got your
results in the form of a raw score and a {\bf percentile rank}.
In this context, the percentile rank is the fraction of people who
scored lower than you (or the same).  So if you are ``in the 90th
percentile,'' you did as well as or better than 90\% of the people who
took the exam.

Here's how you could compute the percentile rank of a value,
\verb"your_score", relative to the scores in the sequence {\tt
  scores}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def PercentileRank(scores, your_score):
    count = 0
    for score in scores:
        if score <= your_score:
            count += 1

    percentile_rank = 100.0 * count / len(scores)
    return percentile_rank
\end{verbatim}

The code in this section is in {\tt chap04.py}.  As an example, if the
scores in the sequence were 55, 66, 77, 88 and 99, and you got the 88,
then your percentile rank would be {\tt 100 * 4 / 5} which is 80.

If you are given a value, it is easy to find its percentile rank; going
the other way is slightly harder.  If you are given a percentile rank
and you want to find the corresponding value, one option is to
sort the values and search for the one you want:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def Percentile(scores, percentile_rank):
    scores.sort()
    for score in scores:
        if PercentileRank(scores, score) >= percentile_rank:
            return score
\end{verbatim}

The result of this calculation is a {\bf percentile}.  For example,
the 50th percentile is the value with percentile rank 50.  In the
distribution of exam scores, the 50th percentile is 77.
\index{percentile}

This implementation of {\tt Percentile} is not very efficient.  A
better approach is to use the percentile rank to compute the index of
the corresponding percentile:

\begin{verbatim}
def Percentile2(scores, percentile_rank):
    scores.sort()
    index = percentile_rank * (len(scores)-1) / 100
    return scores[index]
\end{verbatim}

The difference between ``percentile'' and ``percentile rank'' can
be confusing, and people do not always use the terms precisely.
To summarize, {\tt PercentileRank} takes a score and computes
its percentile rank in a set of scores; {\tt Percentile} takes
a percentile rank and computes the corresponding score.


\section{Conditional distributions}
\index{conditional distribution}
\index{distribution!conditional}

A {\bf conditional distribution} is the distribution of a subset of
the data, selected according to some condition.

For example, if you are above average in weight, but way above average
in height, then you might be relatively light for your height.  Here's
how you could make that claim more precise.

\begin{enumerate}

\item Select a cohort of people who are the same height as you (within
some range).
\index{cohort}

\item Find the CDF of weight for those people.

\item Find the percentile rank of your weight in that distribution.

\end{enumerate}

Percentile ranks are useful for comparing measurements across
different groups.  For example, people who compete in foot races are
usually grouped by age and gender.  To compare people in different
age groups, you can convert race times to percentile ranks.
\index{percentile rank} \index{rank!percentile}

A few years ago I ran the James Joyce Ramble 10K in
Dedham MA; the results are available from
\url{http://coolrunning.com/results/10/ma/Apr25_27thAn_set1.shtml}.
I finished in 42:44, which was 97th in a field of 1633.  I beat or
tied 1537 runners out of 1633, so my percentile rank in the field is
94\%.  \index{James Joyce Ramble} \index{race time}

More generally, given position and field size, we can compute
percentile rank:

\begin{verbatim}
def PositionToPercentile(position, field_size):
    beat = field_size - position + 1
    percentile = 100.0 * beat / field_size
    return percentile
\end{verbatim}

In my age group, denoted M4049 for ``male between 40 and 49 years of
age'', I came in 26th out of 256.  So my percentile rank in my age
group was 90\%.

If I am still running in 10 years (and I hope I am), I will be in
the M5059 division.  Assuming that my percentile rank in my division
is the same, how much slower should I expect to be?

I can answer that question by converting my percentile rank in M4049
to a position in M5059.  Here's the code:

\begin{verbatim}
def PercentileToPosition(percentile, field_size):
    beat = percentile * field_size / 100.0
    position = field_size - beat + 1
    return position
\end{verbatim}

There were 171 people in M5059, so I would have to come in between
17th and 18th place to have the same percentile rank.  The finishing
time of the 17th runner in M5059 was 46:05, so in the next 10 years I
should expect to slow down by 3--4 minutes.

I maintain a friendly rivalry with a student who is in the
F2039 division.  How fast does she have to run her next 10K to
``beat'' me in terms of percentile ranks?


\section{Cumulative distribution functions}
\index{cumulative distribution function}
\index{CDF}

Now that we understand percentiles and percentile ranks,
we are ready to tackle the {\bf cumulative distribution function}
(CDF).  The CDF is the function that maps from a value to its
percentile rank in a distribution.

The CDF is a function of $x$, where $x$ is any value that might appear
in the distribution.  To evaluate $\CDF(x)$ for a particular value of
$x$, we compute the fraction of values in the distribution less
than or equal to $x$.

Here's what that looks like as a function that takes a sample,
{\tt t}, and a value, {\tt x}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
def EvalCdf(t, x):
    count = 0.0
    for value in t:
        if value <= x:
            count += 1

    prob = count / len(t)
    return prob
\end{verbatim}

This function should look familiar; it is almost identical to {\tt
  PercentileRank}, except that the result is in a probability in the
range 0--1 rather than a percentile rank in the range 0--100.

As an example, suppose a sample has the values {\tt [1, 2, 2, 3, 5]}.
Here are some values from its CDF:
%
\[ CDF(0) = 0 \]
%
\[ CDF(1) = 0.2\]
%
\[ CDF(2) = 0.6\]
%
\[ CDF(3) = 0.8\]
%
\[ CDF(4) = 0.8\]
%
\[ CDF(5) = 1\]
%
We can evaluate the CDF for any value of $x$, not just
values that appear in the sample.
If $x$ is less than the smallest value in the sample, $\CDF(x)$ is 0.
If $x$ is greater than the largest value, $\CDF(x)$ is 1.

\begin{figure}
% cumulative.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/cumulative_example_cdf.pdf}}
\caption{Example of a CDF.}
\label{example_cdf}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{example_cdf} is a graphical representation of this CDF.
The CDF of a sample is a step function.


\section{Representing CDFs}
\index{{\tt cdf.py}@{\tt Cdf.py}}
\index{Cdf object}

{\tt thinkstats2} provides a class named
{\tt Cdf} that represents CDFs.
Cdfs are implemented with two sorted lists: {\tt xs}, which contains
the values, and {\tt ps}, which contains the probabilities.  The
fundamental methods {\tt Cdf} provides are:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt Prob(x)}: Given a value {\tt x}, computes the probability
  $p = \CDF(x)$.

\item {\tt Value(p)}: Given a probability {\tt p}, computes the
corresponding value, {\tt x}; that is, the {\bf inverse CDF} of {\tt p}.

\end{itemize}

Because {\tt xs} and {\tt ps} are sorted, these operations use the
bisection algorithm, which is efficient; the run time is proportional
to the logarithm of the number of values; see
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity}.
\index{bisection algorithm}

\begin{figure}
% cumulative.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/cumulative_prglngth_cdf.pdf}}
\caption{CDF of birth weights.}
\label{cumulative_prglngth_cdf}
\end{figure}

The Cdf constructor can take as an argument a list of values,
a pandas Series, a Hist, Pmf, or another Cdf.

{\tt thinkplot.py} provides functions named {\tt Cdf} and
{\tt Cdfs} that plot Cdfs as lines.
\index{{\tt thinkplot.py}}
For example, here's the code to make and plot the CDF of pregnancy
length for all live births.

\begin{verbatim}
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(live.prglngth, label='prglngth')
    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='weeks', ylabel='CDF')
\end{verbatim}

This code is in {\tt cumulative.py}.
Figure~\ref{cumulative_prglngth_cdf} shows the result.  One way to
read a CDF is to look up percentiles.  For example, it looks like
about 10\% of pregnancies are shorter than 36 weeks, and about 90\%
are shorter than 41 weeks.  The CDF also provides a visual
representation of the shape of the distribution.  Common values appear
as steep or vertical sections of the CDF; in this example, the mode at
39 weeks is apparent.  There are very few values below 30 weeks, so
the CDF in this range is flat.

It takes some time to get used to CDFs, but once you
do, I think you will find that they show more information, more
clearly, than PMFs.


\section{Comparing CDFs}
\label{birth_weights}
\index{National Survey of Family Growth}
\index{NSFG}
\index{birth weight}
\index{weight!birth}

CDFs are especially useful for comparing distributions.  For
example, here is the code that plots the CDF of birth
weight for first babies and others.

\begin{verbatim}
    first_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(firsts.totalwgt_lb, label='first')
    other_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(others.totalwgt_lb, label='other')

    thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
    thinkplot.Cdfs([first_cdf, other_cdf])
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='weight (pounds)', ylabel='CDF')
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
% cumulative.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/cumulative_birthwgt_cdf.pdf}}
\caption{CDF of birth weights for first babies and others.}
\label{cumulative_birthwgt_cdf}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{cumulative_birthwgt_cdf} shows the result.
This figure makes the shape of the distributions, and the differences
between them, much clearer.  We can see that first babies are slightly
lighter throughout the distribution, with a larger discrepancy above 
the mean.
\index{shape}




\section{Percentile-based statistics}
\index{summary statistic}
\index{interquartile range}
\index{quartile}
\index{percentile}
\index{median}
\index{central tendency}
\index{spread}

Once you have computed a CDF, it is easy to compute percentiles
and percentile ranks.  {\tt Cdf} provides these two methods:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt PercentileRank(x)}: Given a value {\tt x}, computes its
  percentile rank, $100 \CDF(x)$.

\item {\tt Percentile(p)}: Given a percentile rank {\tt rank},
  computes the corresponding value, {\tt x}.  Equivalent to {\tt
    Value(p/100)}.

\end{itemize}

{\tt Percentile} can be used to compute percentile-based summary
statistics.  For example, the 50th percentile is the value that
divides the distribution in half, also known as the {\bf median}.
Like the mean, the median is a measure of the central tendency
of a distribution.

Actually, there are several definitions of ``median,'' each with
different properties.  But {\tt Percentile(50)} is simple and
efficient to compute.

Another percentile-based statistic is the {\bf interquartile range} (IQR),
which is a measure of the spread of a distribution.  The IQR
is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles.

More generally, percentiles are often used to summarize the shape
of a distribution.  For example, the distribution of income is
often reported in ``quintiles''; that is, it is split at the
the 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th percentiles.  Other distributions
are divided into ten ``deciles''.  Statistics like these that represent
equally-spaced points in a CDF are called {\bf quantiles}.
For more, see \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile}.


\section{Random numbers}
\label{random}
\index{random number}

Suppose we choose a random sample from the population of live
births and look up the percentile rank of their birth weights.
Now suppose we compute the CDF of the percentile ranks.  What do
you think the distribution will look like?

Here's the code to compute it:

\begin{verbatim}
    weights = live.totalwgt_lb
    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(weights, label='totalwgt_lb')

    sample = np.random.choice(weights, 100, replace=True)
    ranks = [cdf.PercentileRank(x) for x in sample]

    rank_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(ranks)
    thinkplot.Cdf(rank_cdf)
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='percentile rank', ylabel='CDF')
\end{verbatim}

{\tt cdf} is the distribution of all birthweights.  {\tt sample}
is a random sample of 100 birthweights, chosen with replacement;
that is, the same value could be chosen more than once.

\begin{figure}
% cumulative.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/cumulative_random.pdf}}
\caption{CDF of percentile ranks for a random sample of birth weights.}
\label{cumulative_random}
\end{figure}

{\tt ranks} is a list of percentile ranks for the 100 values
in the sample.  \verb"rank_cdf" is the CDF of those ranks.
Figure~\ref{cumulative_random} shows the result.  The CDF is
approximately a straight line, which means that the distribution
is uniform.

That result might be non-obvious, but it is a consequence of
the way the CDF is defined.  What this figure shows is that 10\%
of the sample is below the 10th percentile, 20\% are below the
20th percentile, and so on, exactly as we should expect.

So, regardless of the shape of the CDF, the distribution of
percentile ranks is uniform.  This property is useful, because it
is the basis of a simple and efficient algorithm for generating
random numbers with a given CDF.  Here's how:
\index{inverse CDF algorithm}

\begin{itemize}

\item Choose a percentile rank uniformly from the range 0--100.

\item Use {\tt Cdf.Percentile} to find the value in the distribution
that corresponds to the percentile rank you chose.

\end{itemize}

{\tt Cdf} provides an implementation of this algorithm, called
{\tt Random}:

\begin{verbatim}
# class Cdf:
    def Random(self):
        return self.Percentile(random.uniform(0, 100))
\end{verbatim}

{\tt Cdf} also provides {\tt Sample}, which takes an integer,
{\tt n}, and returns a list of {\tt n} values chosen at random
from the Cdf.

If {\tt Sample} works correctly, the distribution of the sample
should match the original distribution.  Here's how we can check:

\begin{verbatim}
    weights = live.totalwgt_lb
    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(weights, label='totalwgt_lb')

    sample = cdf.Sample(1000)
    sample_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(sample, label='sample')
    thinkplot.Cdfs([cdf, sample_cdf])
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='weight (pounds)',
                   ylabel='CDF')
\end{verbatim}

Again, {\tt cdf} is the distribution of birth weights for live
births.  {\tt sample} is a random sample drawn from {\tt cdf},
and \verb"sample_cdf" is its Cdf.

This code is in {\tt cumulative.py}; you can run it to confirm
that {\tt Cdf.Sample} works.



\section{Exercises}

For the following exercises, you can start with \verb"chap04ex.ipynb".
My solution is in \verb"chap04ex_soln.ipynb".

\begin{exercise}
How much did you weigh at birth?  If you don't know, call your mother
or someone else who knows.  Using the NSFG data (all live births),
compute the distribution of birth weights and use it to find your
percentile rank.  If you were a first baby, find your percentile rank
in the distribution for first babies.  Otherwise use the distribution
for others.  If you are in the 90th percentile or higher, call your
mother back and apologize.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
The numbers generated by {\tt random.random} are supposed to be
uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range
should have the same probability.

Generate 1000 numbers from {\tt random.random} and plot their
PMF and CDF.  Is the distribution uniform?

\label{analytic}
\index{analytic distribution}
\index{distribution!analytic}
\index{empirical distribution}
\index{distribution!empirical}

The distributions we have used so far are called {\bf empirical
  distributions} because they are based on empirical observations,
which are necessarily finite samples.

The alternative is an {\bf analytic distribution}, which is
characterized by a CDF that is an analytic function (as opposed to a
step function).

Analytic distributions can be used to model empirical distributions.
In this context, a {\bf model} is a simplification that leaves out
unneeded details.  This chapter presents common analytic distributions
and uses them to model data from a variety of sources.

The code for this chapter is in {\tt analytic.py}.  For information
about downloading and working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.

% analytic.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/analytic_expo_cdf.pdf}}
\caption{CDFs of exponential distributions with various parameters.}
\label{analytic_expo_cdf}
\end{figure}

I'll start with the {\bf exponential distribution} because it is
relatively simple.  The CDF of the exponential distribution is an
analytic function:
%
\[ \CDF(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]
%
The parameter, $\lambda$, determines the shape of the distribution.
Figure~\ref{analytic_expo_cdf} shows what this CDF looks like with
$\lambda = 0.5, 1, 2$.
  \index{parameter}

In the real world, exponential distributions
come up when we look at a series of events and measure the
times between events, called {\bf interarrival times}.
If the events are equally likely to occur at any time, the distribution
of interarrival times tends to look like an exponential distribution.
\index{interarrival time}

As an example, we will look at the interarrival time of births.
On December 18, 1997, 44 babies were born in a hospital in Brisbane,
Australia.\footnote{This example is based on information and data from
  Dunn, ``A Simple Dataset for Demonstrating Common Distributions,''
  Journal of Statistics Education v.7, n.3 (1999).}  The time of
birth for all 44 babies was reported in the local paper; the
complete dataset is in a file called {\tt babyboom.dat}, in the
{\tt ThinkStats2} repository.

\end{verbatim}

{\tt ReadBabyBoom} reads the data file and returns a DataFrame
with columns {\tt time}, {\tt sex}, \verb"weight_g", and {\tt minutes},
where {\tt minutes} is time of birth converted to minutes since
midnight.

%\caption{CCDF of interarrival times.}
%\label{analytic_interarrival_ccdf}
%\end{figure}

{\tt diffs} is the difference between consecutive birth times, and
{\tt cdf} is the distribution of these interarrival times.
Figure~\ref{analytic_interarrival_cdf} shows the CDF (left).  It seems
to have the general shape of an exponential distribution, but how can
we tell?

One way is to plot the {\bf complementary CDF}, which is $1 - \CDF(x)$,
on a log-y scale.  For data from an exponential distribution, the
result is a straight line.  Let's see why that works.
\index{complementary CDF} \index{CDF!complementary} \index{CCDF}

If you plot the complementary CDF (CCDF) of a dataset that you think is
exponential, you expect to see a function like:
%
\[ y \approx e^{-\lambda x} \]
%
Taking the log of both sides yields:
%
\[ \log y \approx -\lambda x\]
%
So on a log-y scale the CCDF is a straight line
with slope $-\lambda$.  Here's how we can generate a plot like that:
\index{logarithmic scale}
\index{complementary CDF}
\index{CDF!complementary}
\index{CCDF}


\begin{verbatim}
    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf, complement=True)
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='minutes',
                   ylabel='CCDF',
                   yscale='log')
\end{verbatim}

With the argument {\tt complement=True}, {\tt thinkplot.Cdf} computes
the complementary CDF before plotting.  And with {\tt yscale='log'},
{\tt thinkplot.Show} sets the {\tt y} axis to a logarithmic scale.

Figure~\ref{analytic_interarrival_cdf} shows the result (right).  It is not
exactly straight, which indicates that the exponential distribution is
not a perfect model for this data.  Most likely the underlying
assumption---that a birth is equally likely at any time of day---is
not exactly true.  Nevertheless, it might be reasonable to model this
dataset with an exponential distribution.  In that case we can
summarize the distribution with a single parameter.

The parameter, $\lambda$, can be interpreted as a rate; that is, the
number of events that occur, on average, in a unit of time.  In this
example, 44 babies are born in 24 hours, so the rate is $\lambda =
1.83$ births per hour.  The mean of an exponential distribution is
$1/\lambda$, so the mean time between births is 0.55 hours.


\section{The normal distribution}
\label{normal}

The {\bf normal distribution}, also called Gaussian, is commonly
used because it describes so many phenomena, at least approximately.
It turns out that there is a good reason for its ubiquity, which we
will get to in Section~\ref{CLT}.

%

\begin{figure}
% analytic.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/analytic_gaussian_cdf.pdf}}
\caption{CDF of normal distributions with a range of parameters.}
\label{analytic_gaussian_cdf}
\end{figure}

The normal distribution is characterized by two parameters: the mean,
$\mu$, and standard deviation $\sigma$.  The normal distribution with
$\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$ is called the {\bf standard normal
  distribution}.  Its CDF is defined by an integral that does not have
a closed form solution, but there are algorithms that evaluate it
efficiently.  One of them is provided by SciPy: {\tt scipy.stats.norm}
is an object that represents a normal distribution; it provides a
method, {\tt cdf}, that evaluates the standard normal CDF:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> import scipy.stats
>>> scipy.stats.norm.cdf(0)
0.5
\end{verbatim}

This result is correct: the median of the standard normal distribution
is 0 (the same as the mean), and half of the values fall below the
median, so $\CDF(0)$ is 0.5.

{\tt norm.cdf} takes optional parameters: {\tt loc}, which
specifies the mean, and {\tt scale}, which specifies the
standard deviation.

{\tt thinkstats2} makes this function a little easier to use
by providing {\tt GaussianCdf}, which takes parameters {\tt mu}
and {\tt sigma} and evaluates the CDF at {\tt x}:

\begin{verbatim}
def EvalGaussianCdf(x, mu=0, sigma=1):
    return scipy.stats.norm.cdf(x, loc=mu, scale=sigma)
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{analytic_gaussian_cdf} shows CDFs for normal
distributions with a range of parameters.  The sigmoid shape of these
curves is a recognizable characteristic of a normal distribution.

In the previous chapter we looked at the distribution of birth
weights in the NSFG.  Figure~\ref{analytic_birthwgt_model} shows the
empirical CDF of weights for all live births and the CDF of
a normal distribution with the same mean and variance.

\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/analytic_birthwgt_model.pdf}}
\caption{CDF of birth weights with a normal model.}
\label{analytic_birthwgt_model}
\end{figure}

The normal distribution is a good model for this dataset, so
we can summarize the distribution with the parameters
$\mu = 7.28$ and $\sigma = 1.24$, and the resulting error
(difference between the model and the data) is small.
\index{model}
\index{percentile}

Below the 10th percentile there is a discrepancy between the data
and the model; there are more light babies than we would expect in
a normal distribution.  If we are interested in studying preterm
babies, it would be important to get this part of the distribution
right, so it might not be appropriate to use the normal
model.

For the exponential distribution, and a few others, there are
simple transformations we can use to test whether an analytic
distribution is a good model of a dataset.
\index{model}
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

For the normal distribution there is no such transformation, but there
is an alternative called a {\bf normal probability plot}.  There
are two ways to generate a normal probability plot: the hard way
and the easy way.  If you are interested in the hard way, you can
read about it at \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_probability_plot}.
Here's the easy way:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Sort the values in the sample.

\item From a standard normal distribution ($\mu=0$ and $\sigma=1$),
generate a sample with the same size as the sample, and sort it.

\item Plot the sorted values from the sample versus the random values.

\end{enumerate}

If the distribution of the sample is approximately normal, the result
is a straight line with intercept {\tt mu} and slope {\tt sigma}.
{\tt thinkstats2} provides {\tt NormalProbability}, which takes a
sample and returns two NumPy arrays:

\begin{verbatim}
xs, ys = thinkstats2.NormalProbability(sample)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}
% analytic.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/analytic_normal_prob_example.pdf}}
\caption{Normal probability plot for random samples from normal distributions.}
\label{analytic_normal_prob_example}
\end{figure}

{\tt ys} contains the sorted values from {\tt sample}; {\tt xs}
contains the random values from the standard normal distribution.

To test {\tt NormalProbability} I generated some fake samples that
were actually drawn from normal distributions with various parameters.
Figure~\ref{analytic_normal_prob_example} shows the results.
The lines are approximately straight, with values in the tails
deviating more than values near the mean.

Now let's try it with real data.  Here's code to generate
a normal probability plot for the birth weight data from the
previous section.  It plots a gray line that represents the model
and a blue line that represents the data.

\begin{verbatim}
    mean = weights.mean()
    std = weights.std()

    xs = [-4, 4]
    xs, ys = thinkstats2.FitLine(xs, inter=mean, slope=std)
    thinkplot.Plot(xs, ys, color='gray', label='model')

    xs, ys = thinkstats2.NormalProbability(weights)
    thinkplot.Plot(xs, ys, label='birth weights')
\end{verbatim}

{\tt weights} is a pandas Series of birth weights;
{\tt mean} and {\tt std} are the mean and standard deviation.

{\tt FitLine} takes a sequence of {\tt xs}, an intercept, and a
slope; it returns {\tt xs} and {\tt ys} that represent a line
with the given parameters, evaluated at the values in {\tt xs}.

{\tt NormalProbability} returns {\tt xs} and {\tt ys} that
contain values from the standard normal distribution and values
from {\tt weights}.  If the distribution of weights is normal,
the data should match the model.

\begin{figure}
% analytic.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/analytic_birthwgt_normal.pdf}}
\caption{Normal probability plot of birth weights.}
\label{analytic_birthwgt_normal}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{analytic_birthwgt_normal} shows the results for
all live births, and also for full term births (pregnancy length greater
than 36 weeks).  Both curves match the model near the mean and
deviate in the tails.  The heaviest babies are heavier than what
the model expects, and the lightest babies are lighter.

When we select only full term births, we remove some of the lightest
weights, which reduces the deviation in the lower tail of the
distribution.

This plot suggests that the normal model describes the distribution
well within a few standard deviations from the mean, but not in the
tails.  Whether it is good enough for practical purposes depends
on the purposes.

\section{The lognormal distribution}
\label{brfss}
\label{lognormal}

If the logarithms of a set of values have a normal distribution, the
values have a {\bf lognormal distribution}.  The CDF of the lognormal
distribution is the same as the CDF of the normal distribution,
with $\log x$ substituted for $x$.
%
\[ CDF_{lognormal}(x) = CDF_{normal}(\log x)\]
%
The parameters of the lognormal distribution are usually denoted
$\mu$ and $\sigma$.  But remember that these parameters are {\em not}
the mean and standard deviation; the mean of a lognormal distribution
is $\exp(\mu +\sigma^2/2)$ and the standard deviation is
ugly (see \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution}).
\index{parameter} \index{weight!adult} \index{adult weight}

\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/brfss_weight.pdf}}
\caption{CDF of adult weights on a linear scale (left) and
log scale (right).}
\label{brfss_weight}
\end{figure}

If a sample is approximately lognormal and you plot its CDF on a
log-x scale, it will have the characteristic shape of a normal
distribution.  To test how well the sample fits a lognormal model, you
can make a normal probability plot using the log of the values
in the sample.

As an example, let's look at the distribution of adult weights, which
is approximately lognormal.\footnote{I was tipped off to this
  possibility by a comment (without citation) at
  \url{http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LogNormalDistribution.html}.
  Subsequently I found a paper that proposes the log transform and
  suggests a cause: Penman and Johnson, ``The Changing Shape of the
  Body Mass Index Distribution Curve in the Population,'' Preventing
  Chronic Disease, 2006 July; 3(3): A74.  Online at
  \url{http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1636707}.}

The National Center for Chronic Disease
Prevention and Health Promotion conducts an annual survey as part of
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS).\footnote{Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
  (CDC). Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System Survey
  Data. Atlanta, Georgia: U.S. Department of Health and Human
  Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008.}  In
2008, they interviewed 414,509 respondents and asked about their
demographics, health and health risks.
Among the data they collected are the weights in kilograms of
398,484 respondents.
\index{Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System}
\index{BRFSS}

The repository for this book contains {\tt CDBRFS08.ASC.gz},
a fixed-width ASCII file that contains data from the BRFSS,
and {\tt brfss.py}, which reads the file and analyses the data.

\begin{figure}
% brfss.py
\centerline{
\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/brfss_weight_normal.pdf}}
\caption{Normal probability plots for adult weight on a linear scale
  (left) and log scale (right).}
\label{brfss_weight_normal}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{brfss_weight} shows the distribution of adult weights on a
linear scale, with a normal model, and on a log scale, with a
lognormal model.  The lognormal model is a better fit, but this
representation of the data does not make the difference particularly
dramatic.  \index{respondent} \index{model}

Figure~\ref{brfss_weight_normal} shows normal probability plots
for adult weights, $w$, and for their logarithms, $\log_{10} w$.
Now it is apparent that the data deviate substantially from the
normal model.  The lognormal model is a good match for the data
within a few standard deviations of the mean, but it deviates in
the tails.  I would conclude that the lognormal distribution is
a good model for this data.

\section{The Pareto distribution}
\index{Pareto distribution}
\index{distribution!Pareto}
\index{Pareto, Vilfredo}

The {\bf Pareto distribution} is named after the economist Vilfredo Pareto,
who used it to describe the distribution of wealth (see
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution}).  Since then, it
has been used to describe phenomena in the natural and social sciences
including sizes of cities and towns, sand particles and meteorites,
forest fires and earthquakes.  \index{CDF}

The CDF of the Pareto distribution is:
%
\[ CDF(x) = 1 - \left( \frac{x}{x_m} \right) ^{-\alpha} \]
%
The parameters $x_{m}$ and $\alpha$ determine the location and shape
of the distribution. $x_{m}$ is the minimum possible value.
Figure~\ref{analytic_pareto_cdf} shows CDFs of Pareto
distributions with $x_{m} = 0.5$ and different values
of $\alpha$.
\index{parameter}

\begin{figure}
% analytic.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/analytic_pareto_cdf.pdf}}
\caption{CDFs of Pareto distributions with different parameters.}
\label{analytic_pareto_cdf}
\end{figure}

There is a simple visual test that indicates whether an empirical
distribution fits a Pareto distribution: on a log-log scale, the CCDF
looks like a straight line.  Let's see why that works.

If you plot the CCDF of a sample from a Pareto distribution on a
linear scale, you expect to see a function like:
%
\[ y \approx \left( \frac{x}{x_m} \right) ^{-\alpha} \]
%
Taking the log of both sides yields:
%
\[ \log y \approx -\alpha (\log x - \log x_{m})\]
%
So if you plot $\log y$ versus $\log x$, it should look like a straight
line with slope $-\alpha$ and intercept
$\alpha \log x_{m}$.

As an example, let's look at the sizes of cities and towns in the
United States.  The U.S.~Census Bureau publishes data on the
population of every incorporated city and town in the United States.
\index{Pareto distribution} \index{distribution!Pareto}

% populations.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/populations_pareto.pdf}}
\caption{CCDFs of city and town populations, on a log-log scale.}
\label{populations_pareto}
\end{figure}

I downloaded their data from
\url{http://www.census.gov/popest/data/cities/totals/2012/SUB-EST2012-3.html};
it is in the repository for this book in a file named
\verb"PEP_2012_PEPANNRES_with_ann.csv".  The repository also
contains {\tt populations.py}, which reads the data file and plots
the distribution of populations.

Figure~\ref{populations_pareto} shows the CCDF of populations on a
log-log scale.  The largest 1\% of cities and towns, below $10^{-2}$,
fall along a straight line.  So we could
conclude, as some researchers have, that the tail of this distribution
fits a Pareto model.

On the other hand, a lognormal distribution also models the data well.
Figure~\ref{populations_normal} shows the CDF of populations and a
lognormal model (left), and a normal probability plot (right).  Both
plots show good agreement between the data and the model.

Neither model is perfect.
The Pareto model only applies to the largest 1\% of cities, but it
is a better fit for that part of the distribution.  The lognormal
model is a better fit for the other 99\%.
Which model is appropriate depends on which part of the distribution
you is relevant.

\section{Generating random numbers}
\index{exponential distribution}
\index{distribution!exponential}
\index{random number}
\index{CDF}
\index{inverse CDF algorithm}
\index{uniform distribution}
\index{distribution!uniform}

Analytic CDFs can be used to generate random numbers with a given
distribution function, $p = \CDF(x)$.  If there is an efficient way to
compute the inverse CDF, we can generate random values
with the appropriate distribution by choosing $p$ from a uniform
distribution from 0 to 1, then choosing
$x = ICDF(p)$.

For example, the CDF of the exponential distribution is
%
\[ p = 1 - e^{-\lambda x} \]
%
Solving for $x$ yields:
%
\[ x = -\log (1 - p) / \lambda \]
%
So in Python we can write
%
\begin{verbatim}
def expovariate(lam):
    p = random.random()
    x = -math.log(1-p) / lam
    return x
\end{verbatim}

{\tt expovariate} takes {\tt lam} and returns a random value chosen
from the exponential distribution with parameter {\tt lam}.

Two notes about this implementation:
I called the parameter \verb"lam" because \verb"lambda" is a Python
keyword.  Also, since $\log 0$ is undefined, we have to
be a little careful.  Most implementations of {\tt random.random}
can return 0 but not 1, so $1 - p$ can be 1 but not 0, 
so that works out well.  \index{random module}


\section{Why model?}
\index{model}

At the beginning of this chapter, I said that many real world phenomena
can be modeled with analytic distributions.  ``So,'' you might ask,
``what?''  \index{abstraction}

Like all models, analytic distributions are abstractions, which
means they leave out details that are considered irrelevant.
For example, an observed distribution might have measurement errors
or quirks that are specific to the sample; analytic models smooth
out these idiosyncrasies.
\index{smoothing}

Analytic models are also a form of data compression.  When a model
fits a dataset well, a small set of parameters can summarize a
large amount of data.
\index{parameter}
\index{compression}

It is sometimes surprising when data from a natural phenomenon fit an
analytic distribution, but these observations can provide insight
into physical systems.  Sometimes we can explain why an observed
distribution has a particular form.  For example, Pareto distributions
are often the result of generative processes with positive feedback
(so-called preferential attachment processes: see
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Preferential_attachment}.).
\index{preferential attachment}
\index{generative process}
\index{Pareto distribution}
\index{distribution!Pareto}
\index{analysis}

Also, analytic distributions lend themselves to mathematical
analysis, as we will see in Chapter~\ref{operations}.

But it is important to remember that all models are imperfect.
Data from the real world never fit an analytic distribution perfectly.
People sometimes talk as if data are generated by models; for example,
they might say that the distribution of human heights is normal,
or the distribution of income is lognormal.  Taken literally, these
claims cannot be true; there are always differences between the
real world and mathematical models.

Models are useful if they capture the relevant aspects of the
real world and leave out unneeded details.  But what is ``relevant''
or ``unneeded'' depends on what you are planning to use the model
for.


\section{Exercises}

For the following exercises, you can start with \verb"chap05ex.ipynb".
My solution is in \verb"chap05ex_soln.ipynb".

\begin{exercise}
In the BRFSS (see Section~\ref{lognormal}), the distribution of
heights is roughly normal with parameters $\mu = 178$ cm and
$\sigma = 7.7$ cm for men, and $\mu = 163$ cm and $\sigma = 7.3$ cm for
women.
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}

\index{Blue Man Group}
\index{Group, Blue Man}

In order to join Blue Man Group, you have to be male between 5'10''
and 6'1'' (see \url{http://bluemancasting.com}).  What percentage of
the U.S. male population is in this range?  Hint: use {\tt
  scipy.stats.norm.cdf}.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
To get a feel for the Pareto distribution, imagine what the world
would be like if the distribution of human height were Pareto.
Choosing the parameters $x_{m} = 1$ m and $\alpha = 1.7$, we
get a distribution with a reasonable minimum, 1 m,
and median, 1.5 m.
\index{height}

What is the mean human height in Pareto world?  What is the mean of
this sample?  What fraction of the population is shorter than the
mean?  If there are 7 billion people in Pareto world, how many do we
expect to be taller than 1 km?  How tall do we expect the tallest
person to be?
\index{Pareto World}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{weibull}

The Weibull distribution is a generalization of the exponential
distribution that comes up in failure analysis
(see \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Weibull_distribution}).  Its CDF is
%
\[ CDF(x) = 1 - e^{-(x / \lambda)^k} \]
%
Can you find a transformation that makes a Weibull distribution look
like a straight line?  What do the slope and intercept of the
line indicate?
\index{Weibull distribution}
\index{distribution!Weibull}
\index{exponential distribution}
\index{distribution!exponential}
\index{random module}

Use {\tt random.weibullvariate} to generate a sample from a
Weibull distribution and use it to test your transformation.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
For small values of $n$, we don't expect an empirical distribution
to fit an analytic distribution exactly.  One way to evaluate
the quality of fit is to generate a sample from an analytic
distribution and see how well it matches the data.
\index{empirical distribution}
\index{distribution!empirical}
\index{random module}

For example, in Section~\ref{exponential} we plotted the distribution
of time between births and saw that it is approximately exponential.
But the distribution is based on only 44 data points.  To see whether
the data might have come from an exponential distribution, generate 44
values from an exponential distribution with the same mean as the
data, about 33 minutes between births.

Plot the distribution of the random values and compare it to the
actual distribution.  You can use {\tt random.expovariate} 
to generate the values.  A solution to this problem is in
\verb"chap05ex_soln.py".

\end{exercise}

% TODO: put all solutions in one file?

\begin{exercise}
In the repository for this book, you'll find a set of data files
called {\tt mystery0.dat}, {\tt mystery1.dat}, and so on.  Each
contains a sequence of random numbers generated from different
distributions.

You will also find \verb"test_models.py", a script that reads
data from a file and plots the CDF under a variety of transforms.
You can run it like this:

\begin{verbatim}
$ python test_models.py mystery0.dat
\end{verbatim}

Based on these plots, you should be able to infer what kind of
distribution generated each file.  If you are stumped, you can
look in {\tt mystery.py}, which contains the code that generated
the files.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{income}

The distributions of wealth and income are sometimes modeled using
lognormal and Pareto distributions.  To see which is better, let's
look at some data.

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is joint effort of the Bureau
of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau to study income and related
variables.  Data collected in 2013 is available from
\url{http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/cpstables/032013/hhinc/toc.htm}.
I downloaded {\tt hinc06.xls}, which is an Excel spreadsheet with
information about household income, and converted it to {\tt hinc06.csv},
a CSV file you will find in the repository for this book.  You
will also find {\tt hinc.py}, which reads this file.

Extract the distribution of incomes from this dataset.  Are any of the
analytic distributions in this chapter a good model of the data?  A
solution to this exercise is in \url{hinc_soln.py}.

\end{exercise}

\[ \PDF_{normal}(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} 
                 \exp \left[ -\frac{1}{2} 
                 \left( \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right]  \]
%
Evaluating a PDF for a particular value of $x$ is usually not useful.
The result is not a probability; it is a probability {\em density}.
\index{density}
\index{mass}

In physics, density is mass per unit of
volume; in order to get a mass, you have to multiply by volume or,
if the density is not constant, you have to integrate over volume.

Similarly, {\bf probability density} measures probability per unit of $x$.
In order to get a probability mass, you have to integrate over $x$.

{\tt thinkstats2} provides a class called {\tt Pdf} that represents
a probability density function.  Every Pdf object provides the
following methods:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\tt Density}, which takes a value, {\tt x}, and returns the
  density of the distribution at {\tt x}.

\item {\tt Render}, which evaluates the density at a discrete set of
  values and returns a pair of sequences, {\tt xs} and {\tt ps}.

\item {\tt MakePmf}, which uses {\tt Render} to evaluate the density
  at a discrete set of values and returns a normalized Pmf that
  approximates the Pdf.

\item {\tt GetLinspace}, which returns the default set of points used 
  by {\tt Render} and {\tt MakePmf}.

\end{itemize}  

{\tt Pdf} is an abstract parent class, which means you should not
instantiate it; that is, you cannot create a Pdf object.  Instead, you
should define a child class that inherits from {\tt Pdf} and provides
definitions of {\tt Density} and {\tt GetLinspace}.  {\tt Pdf} provides
{\tt Render} and {\tt MakePmf}.

For example, {\tt thinkstats2} provides a class named {\tt
  GaussianPdf} that evaluates the Gaussian density function.

\begin{verbatim}
class GaussianPdf(Pdf):

    def __init__(self, mu=0, sigma=1, label=''):
        self.mu = mu
        self.sigma = sigma
        self.label = label

    def Density(self, xs):
        return scipy.stats.norm.pdf(xs, self.mu, self.sigma)

    def GetLinspace(self):
        low, high = self.mu-3*self.sigma, self.mu+3*self.sigma
        return np.linspace(low, high, 101)
\end{verbatim}

The GaussianPdf object contains the parameters {\tt mu} and
{\tt sigma}.  {\tt Density} uses
{\tt scipy.stats.norm}, which is an object that represents a Gaussian
distribution and provides {\tt cdf} and {\tt pdf}, among other
methods (see Section~\ref{normal}).

The following example creates a GaussianPdf with the mean and variance
of adult female heights, in cm, from the BRFSS (see
Section~\ref{brfss}).  Then it computes the density of the
distribution at a location one standard deviation from the mean.

\begin{verbatim}
>>> mean, var = 163, 52.8
>>> std = math.sqrt(var)
>>> pdf = thinkstats2.GaussianPdf(mean, std)
>>> pdf.Density(mean + std)
0.0333001
\end{verbatim}

The result is about 0.03, in units of probability mass per cm.
Again, a probability density doesn't mean much by itself.  But if
we plot the Pdf, we can see the shape of the distribution:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> thinkplot.Pdf(pdf, label='Gaussian')
>>> thinkplot.Show()
\end{verbatim}

{\tt thinkplot.Pdf} plots the Pdf as a smooth function,
as contrasted with {\tt thinkplot.Pmf}, which renders a Pmf as a
step function.  Figure~\ref{pdf_example} shows the result, as well
as a PDF estimated from a sample, which we'll see in the next
section.

You can use {\tt MakePmf} to approximate the Pdf:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> pmf = pdf.MakePmf()
\end{verbatim}

By default, the resulting Pmf contains 101 points equally spaced from
{\tt mu - 3*sigma} to {\tt mu + 3*sigma}.  Optionally, {\tt MakePmf}
and {\tt Render} can take keyword arguments {\tt low}, {\tt high},
and {\tt n}.

\caption{A Gaussian PDF that models adult female height in the U.S.,
and the kernel density estimate of a sample with $n=1000$.}
\label{pdf_example}
\end{figure}


\section{Kernel density estimation} 

{\bf Kernel density estimation} (KDE) is an algorithm that takes
a sample and finds an appropriately smooth PDF that fits 
the data.  You can read details at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation}.
\index{KDE}
\index{kernel density estimation}

{\tt scipy} provides an implementation of KDE and {\tt thinkstats2}
provides a class called {\tt EstimatedPdf} that uses it:
\index{scipy}
\index{numpy}

\begin{verbatim}
class EstimatedPdf(Pdf):

    def __init__(self, sample):
        self.kde = scipy.stats.gaussian_kde(sample)

    def Density(self, xs):
        return self.kde.evaluate(xs)
\end{verbatim}

\verb"__init__" takes a sample
and computes a kernel density estimate.  The result is a
\verb"gaussian_kde" object that provides an {\tt evaluate}
method.

{\tt Density} takes a value, calls \verb"gaussian_kde.evaluate",
and returns the resulting density.
\index{density}

Here's an example that generates a sample from a Gaussian
distribution and then makes an EstimatedPdf to fit it:
\index{numpy}

\begin{verbatim}
>>> sample = [random.gauss(mean, std) for i in range(100)]
>>> sample_pdf = thinkstats2.EstimatedPdf(sample)
>>> thinkplot.Pdf(pdf, label='sample KDE')
\end{verbatim}

\verb"sample" is a list of 100 random heights.
\verb"sample_pdf" is a {\tt Pdf} object that containts the estimated
KDE of the sample.  {\tt pmf} is a Pmf object that approximates the Pdf by
evaluating the density at a sequence of equally spaced values.

Figure~\ref{pdf_example} shows the Gaussian density function and a KDE
based on a sample of 1000 random heights.  The estimate is a good
match for the original distribution.

Estimating a density function with KDE is useful for several purposes:

\begin{description}

\item[Visualization]: During the exploration phase of a project, CDFs
  are usually the best visualization of a distribution.  After you
  look at a CDF, you can decide whether an estimated PDF is an
  appropriate model of the distribution.  If so, it can be a better
  choice for presenting the distribution to an audience that is
  unfamiliar with CDFs.

\item[Interpolation]: An estimated PDF is a way to get from a sample
  to a model of the population.  If you have reason to believe that
  the population distribution smooth, you can use KDE to interpolate
  the density for values that don't appear in the sample.

\item[Simulation]: If your sample is an input to a simulation, it
  might be appropriate to smooth the sample distribution using KDE.
  That might allow the simulation to explore more possible outcomes,
  rather than replicating the observed data.

\end{description}


\section{The distribution framework}
\index{distribution framework}
\index{framework, distributions}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.2in]{figs/distribution_functions.pdf}}
\caption{A framework that relates representations of distribution
functions.}
\label{dist_framework}
\end{figure}

At this point we have seen PMFs, CDFs and PDFs; let's take a minute
to review.  Figure~\ref{dist_framework} shows how these functions relate
to each other.
\index{PMF}

We started with PMFs, which represent the probabilities for a discrete
set of values.  To get from a PMF to a CDF, you can compute a cumulative
sum.  To be more strictly correct, a discrete CDF should be called a
cumulative mass function (CMF), but as far as I can tell no one uses
that term.  \index{CDF}
To get from a CDF to a PMF, you can compute differences in cumulative
probabilities.

Similarly, a PDF is the derivative of a continuous CDF; or, equivalently,
a CDF is the integral of a PDF.  But remember that a PDF maps from
values to probability densities; to get a probability, you have to
integrate.
\index{discrete}
\index{analytic}

To get from a discrete to a continuous distribution, you can perform
various kinds of smoothing.  One form of smoothing is to assume that
the data come from an analytic continuous distribution
(like exponential or normal) and to estimate the parameters of that
distribution.  Another option is kernel density estimation.
\index{exponential distribution}
\index{distribution!exponential}
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

The opposite of smoothing is {\bf discretizing}, or quantizing.  If you
evaluate a PDF at discrete points, you can generate a PMF that is an
approximation of the PDF.  You can get a better approximation using
numerical integration.  \index{discretize}
\index{quantize}
\index{bin}


\section{Hist implementation}

At this point you should know how to use the basic types provided
by {\tt thinkstats2}: Hist, Pmf, Cdf, and Pdf.  The next few sections
provide details about how they are implemented.

Hist and Pmf inherit from a parent class called \verb"_DictWrapper".
The leading underscore indicates that this class is ``internal;'' that
is, it should not be used by code in other modules.  The name
indicates what it is: a dictionary wrapper.  Its primary attribute is
{\tt d}, the dictionary that maps from values to their frequencies.

The values can be any hashable type.  The frequencies should be integers,
but can be any numeric type.

\verb"_DictWrapper" contains the methods appropriate for both
{\tt Hist} and {\tt Pmf}, including the constructor, {\tt Values},
{\tt Items} and {\tt Render}.  It also provides the modifier
methods {\tt Set}, {\tt Incr}, {\tt Mult}, and {\tt Remove}.  These
methods are all implemented with dictionary operations.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    def Incr(self, x, term=1):
        self.d[x] = self.d.get(x, 0) + term

    def Mult(self, x, factor):
        self.d[x] = self.d.get(x, 0) * factor

    def Remove(self, x):
        del self.d[x]
\end{verbatim}

Because {\tt Hist} operators and methods are based on dictionaries,
you should expect getting and setting items to be constant time operations;
that is, their run time does not increase as the Hist gets bigger.

\verb"_DictWrapper" also provides special methods to support getting
and setting items, so instead of using {\tt Incr} you could write:

\begin{verbatim}
>>> hist = thinkstats2.Hist()
>>> hist['a'] += 1
\end{verbatim}

{\tt Hist} also provides {\tt Freq}, which looks up the frequency
of a given value.


\section{Pmf implementation}

{\tt Pmf} and {\tt Hist} are almost the same thing, except that a Pmf
maps values to floating-point probabilities, rather than integer
frequencies.  If the sum of the probabilities is 1, the Pmf is said to
be normalized.

{\tt Pmf} provides {\tt Normalize}, which computes the sum of the
probabilities and divides through by a factor:

\begin{verbatim}
    def Normalize(self, fraction=1.0):
        total = self.Total()
        if total == 0.0:
            raise ValueError('Normalize: total probability is zero.')

        factor = float(fraction) / total
        for x in self.d:
            self.d[x] *= factor

        return total
\end{verbatim}

{\tt fraction} determines the sum of the probabilities after normalizing;
the default value is 1.
If the total probability is 0, the Pmf cannot be normalized, so
{\tt Normalize} raises and error.

{\tt Hist} and {\tt Pmf} have the same constructor.  It can take
as an argument a Python {\tt dict}, a Hist, Pmf or Cdf, a pandas
Series, a list of (value, frequency) pairs, or a sequence of values.

If you instantiate a Pmf, the result is normalized.  If you
instantiate a Hist, it is not.  To construct an unnormalized Pmf,
you can create an empty Pmf and modify it.  The Pmf modifiers do
not renormalize the Pmf.


\section{Cdf implementation}

A CDF is a map from values to their cumulative probabilities, so
it would be reasonable to implement {\tt Cdf} as a \verb"_DictWrapper".
But the values in a CDF are ordered and the values in a \verb"_DictWrapper"
are not.  Also, it is often useful to compute the inverse CDF; that
is, the mapping from cumulative probability to value.  So the
implementaion I chose is two sorted lists.  That way I can use
bisection to do a forward or inverse mapping in logarithmic time.

The {\tt Cdf} constructor can take as a parameter a sequence of values
or a pandas Series, a dictionary that maps from values to
probabilities, a sequence of (value, probability) pairs, a Hist, Pmf,
or Cdf.  Or if it is given two parameters, it treats them as a sorted
sequence of values and the sequence of corresponding cumulative
probabilities.

Given a sequence, pandas Series, or dictionary, the constructor makes
a Hist.  Then it uses the Hist to initialize the attributes:

\begin{verbatim}
        self.xs, freqs = zip(*sorted(dw.Items()))
        self.ps = np.cumsum(freqs, dtype=np.float)
        self.ps /= self.ps[-1]
\end{verbatim}

{\tt xs} is the sorted list of values; {\tt freqs} is the list
of corresponding frequencies.  {\tt np.cumsum} computes
the cumulative sum of the frequencies.  Dividing through by the
total frequency yields cumulative probabilities.

Here is the implementation of {\tt Prob}, which takes a value
and returns its cumulative probability: 

\begin{verbatim}
    def Prob(self, x):
        if x < self.xs[0]:
            return 0.0
        index = bisect.bisect(self.xs, x)
        p = self.ps[index - 1]
        return p
\end{verbatim}

And here is the implementation of {\tt Value}, which takes a cumulative
probability and returns the corresponding value:

\begin{verbatim}
    def Value(self, p):
        if p < 0 or p > 1:
            raise ValueError('Probability p must be in range [0, 1]')

        index = bisect.bisect_left(self.ps, p)
        return self.xs[index]
\end{verbatim}

Given a Cdf, we can compute the Pmf by computing differences between
consecutive cumulative probabilities.  If you call the Cdf constructor
and pass a Pmf, it computes differences by calling {\tt Cdf.Items}:
\index{Pmf}

\begin{verbatim}
    def Items(self):
        a = self.ps
        b = np.roll(a, 1)
        b[0] = 0
        return zip(self.xs, a-b)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt np.roll} shift the elements of {\tt a} to the right, and ``rolls''
the last one back to the beginning.  We replace the first element of
{\tt b} with 0 and then compute the difference {\tt a-b}.  The result
is a NumPy array of probabilities.

{\tt Cdf} provides {\tt Shift} and {\tt Scale}, which modify the
values in the Cdf, but the probabilities should be treated as
immutable.


\section{Moments}
\index{moment}

Any time you take a sample and reduce it to a single number, that
number is a statistic.  The statistics we have seen so far include
mean, variance, median, and interquartile range.

A {\bf raw moment} is a kind of statistic.  If you have a sample of
values, $x_i$, the $k$th raw moment is:
%
\[ m'_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i x_i^k \]
%
Or if you prefer Python notation:

\begin{verbatim}
def RawMoment(xs, k):
    return sum(x**k for x in xs) / len(xs)
\end{verbatim}

When $k=1$ the result is the sample mean, $\xbar$.  The other
raw moments don't mean much by themselves, but they are used
in some computations.

The {\bf central moments} are more useful.  The
$k$th central moment is:
%
\[ m_k = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i (x_i - \xbar)^k \]
%
Or in Python:

\begin{verbatim}
def CentralMoment(xs, k):
    xbar = RawMoment(xs, 1)
    return sum((x - xbar)**k for x in xs) / len(xs)
\end{verbatim}

When $k=2$ the result is the second central moment, which you might
recognize as variance.  The definition of variance gives a hint about
why these statistics are called moments.  If we place a mass along a
number line at each value, $x_i$, and then spin the number line around
the mean, the moment of inertia of the spinning masses is the variance
of the values.  If you are not familiar with moment of intertia, see
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia}.  \index{moment
  of intertia}.

When you report moment-based statistics, it is important to think
about the units.  For example, if the values $x_i$ are in cm, the
first raw moment is also in cm.  But the second moment is in
cm$^2$, the third moment is in cm$^3$, and so on.

Because of these units, moments are hard to interpret by themselves.
For the second moment, we solve the problem by computing the square
root of variance, known as the standard deviation, which is in the
same units as $x_i$.


\section{Skewness}
\index{skewness}

{\bf Skewness} is a property that describes the shape of a distribution.
If the distribution is symmetric around its central tendency, it is
unskewed.  If the values extend farther to the right, it is ``right
skewed'' and if the values extend left, it is ``left skewed.''

This use of ``skewed'' does not have the usual connotation of
``biased.''  Skewness only describes the shape of the distribution;
it says nothing about whether the sampling process might have been
biased.

Several statistics are commonly used to quantify the skewness of a
distribution.  Given a sequence of values, $x_i$, the {\bf sample
  skewness}, $g_1$, can be computed like this:

\begin{verbatim}
def StandardizedMoment(xs, k):
    var = CentralMoment(xs, 2)
    std = math.sqrt(var)
    return CentralMoment(xs, k) / std**k

def Skewness(xs):
    return StandardizedMoment(xs, 3)
\end{verbatim}

$g_1$ is the third {\bf standardized moment}, which means that it has
been normalized so it has no units.

Negative skewness indicates that a distribution 
skews left; positive skewness indicates
that a distribution skews right.  The magnitude of $g_1$ indicates
the strength of the skewness, but by itself it is not easy to
interpret.

In practice, computing sample skewness is usually not
a good idea.  If there are any outliers, they
have a disproportionate effect on $g_1$.
\index{outlier}

Another way to evaluate the asymmetry of a distribution is to look
at the relationship between the mean and median.
Extreme values have more effect on the mean than the median, so
in a distribution that skews left, the mean is less than the median.
In a distribution that skews right, the mean is greater.
\index{symmetry}
\index{Pearson's median skewness coefficient}
\index{coefficient!skewness}

{\bf Pearson's median skewness coefficient} is an alternative measure
of skewness that explicitly captures the relationship between the
sample mean and median:
%
\[ g_p = 3 (\xbar - m) / S \]
%
Where $\xbar$ is the sample mean, $m$ is the median, and
$S$ is the standard deviation.  Or in Python:

\begin{verbatim}
def Median(xs):
    cdf = thinkstats2.MakeCdfFromList(xs)
    return cdf.Value(0.5)

def PearsonMedianSkewness(xs):
    median = Median(xs)
    mean = RawMoment(xs, 1)
    var = CentralMoment(xs, 2)
    std = math.sqrt(var)
    gp = 3 * (mean - median) / std
    return gp
\end{verbatim}

This statistic is {\bf robust}, which means that it is less vulnerable
to the effect of outliers.
\index{robust}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.2in]{figs/density_totalwgt_kde.pdf}}
\caption{Estimated PDF of birthweight data from the NSFG.}
\label{density_totalwgt_kde}
\end{figure}

As an example, let's look at the skewness of birthweights in the
NSFG pregnancy data.  Here's the code to estimate and plot the PDF:

\begin{verbatim}
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    data = live.totalwgt_lb.dropna()
    pdf = thinkstats2.EstimatedPdf(data)
    thinkplot.Pdf(pdf, label='birth weight')
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{density_totalwgt_kde} shows the result.  The left tail appears
longer than the right, so we suspect the distribution is skewed left.
The mean, 7.27 lbs, is a bit less than
the median, 7.38 lbs, so that is consistent with left skew.
And both skewness coefficients are negative:
sample skewness is -0.59;
Pearson's median skewness is -0.23.

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.2in]{figs/density_wtkg2_kde.pdf}}
\caption{Estimated PDF of adult weight data from the BRFSS.}
\label{density_wtkg2_kde}
\end{figure}

Now let's compare this distribution to the distribution of adult
weight in the BRFSS.  Again, here's the code:

\begin{verbatim}
    df = brfss.ReadBrfss(nrows=None)
    data = df.wtkg2.dropna()
    pdf = thinkstats2.EstimatedPdf(data)
    thinkplot.Pdf(pdf, label='adult weight')
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{density_wtkg2_kde} shows the result.  The distribution
appears skewed to the right.  Sure enough, the mean, 79.0, is bigger
than the median, 77.3.  The sample skewness is 1.1 and Pearson's
median skewness is 0.26.

The sign of the skewness coefficient indicates whether the distribution
skews left or right, but other than that, they are hard to interpret.
Sample skewness is less robust; that is, it is more
susceptible to outliers.  As a result it is less reliable
when applied to skewed distributions, exactly when it would be most
relevant.

Pearson's median skewness is based on a computed mean and variance,
so it is also susceptible to outliers, but since it does not depend
on a third moment, it is somewhat more robust.


\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}

The distribution of income is famously skewed to the right.  In this
exercise, we'll measure how strong that skew is.

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is joint effort of the Bureau
of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau to study income and related
variables.  Data collected in 2013 is available from
\url{http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/cpstables/032013/hhinc/toc.htm}.
I downloaded {\tt hinc06.xls}, which is an Excel spreadsheet with
information about household income, and converted it to {\tt hinc06.csv},
a CSV file you will find in the repository for this book.  You
will also find {\tt hinc2.py}, which reads this file and transforms
the data.

The dataset is in the form of a series of income ranges and the number
of respondents who fell in each range.  The lowest range includes
respondents who reported annual household income ``Under \$5000.''
The highest range includes respondents who made ``\$250,0000 or
more.''

To estimate mean and other statistics from these data, we have to
make some assumptions about the lower and upper bounds, and how
the values are distributed in each range.  {\tt hinc2.py} provides
{\tt InterpolateSample}, which shows one way to model
this data.  It takes a DataFrame with a column, {\tt income}, that
contains the upper bound of each range, and {\tt freq}, which contains
the number of respondents in each frame.

It also takes \verb"log_upper", which is an assumed upper bound
on the highest range, expressed in {\tt log10} dollars.  
The default value, \verb"log_upper=6.0" represents the assumption
that the largest income among the respondents is
$10^6$, or one million dollars.

{\tt InterpolateSample} generates a pseudo-sample; that is, a sample
of household incomes that yields the same number of respondents
in each range as the actual data.  It assumes that incomes in
each range are equally spaced on a log10 scale.

Compute the median, mean, skewness and Pearson's skewness of the
resulting sample.  What fraction of households reports a taxable
income below the mean?  How do the results depend on the assumed
upper bound?

A solution to this exercise is in \verb"hinc2_soln.py".

\chapter{Relationships between variables}

So far we have only looked at one variable at a time.  In this
chapter we look at relationships between variables.  Two variables are
related if knowing one gives you information about the other.  For
example, height and weight are related; people who are taller tend to
be heavier.  Of course, it is not a perfect relationship: there
are short, heavy people and tall, light people.  But if you are
trying to guess someone's weight, you will be more accurate if you
know their height than if you don't.

The code for this chapter is in {\tt scatter.py}.
For information about downloading and
working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.


\section{Scatter plots}
\index{scatter plot}
\index{plot!scatter}
\index{pyplot}

\begin{figure}
% scatter.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=3.0in]{figs/scatter1.pdf}}
\caption{Scatter plots of weight versus height for the respondents
in the BRFSS, unjittered (left), jittered (right).}
\label{scatter1}
\end{figure}

The simplest way to check for a relationship between two variables
is a {\bf scatter plot}, but making a good scatter plot is not always easy.
As an example, I'll plot weight versus height for the respondents
in the BRFSS (see Section~\ref{lognormal}).

Here's the code that reads the data file and extracts height and
weight:

\begin{verbatim}
    df = brfss.ReadBrfss(nrows=None)
    sample = thinkstats2.SampleRows(df, 5000)
    heights, weights = sample.htm3, sample.wtkg2
\end{verbatim}

{\tt SampleRows} chooses a random subset of the data:

\begin{verbatim}
def SampleRows(df, nrows, replace=False):
    indices = np.random.choice(df.index, nrows, replace=replace)
    sample = df.loc[indices]
    return sample
\end{verbatim}

{\tt df} is the DataFrame, {\tt nrows} is the number of rows to choose,
and {\tt replace} is a boolean indicating whether sampling should be
done with replacement; in other words, whether the same row could be
chosen more than one.

{\tt thinkplot} provides {\tt Scatter}, which makes scatter plots:
%
\begin{verbatim}
    thinkplot.Scatter(heights, weights)
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='Height (cm)',
                   ylabel='Weight (kg)',
                   axis=[140, 210, 20, 200])
\end{verbatim}

The result, in Figure~\ref{scatter1} (left), shows the shape of
the relationship.  As we expected, taller
people tend to be heavier.  

\begin{figure}
% scatter.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=3.0in]{figs/scatter2.pdf}}
\caption{Scatter plot with jittering and transparency (left),
hexbin plot (right).}
\label{scatter2}
\end{figure}

But this is not the best representation of
the data, because the data are packed into columns.  The problem is
that the heights are rounded to the nearest inch, converted to
centimeters, and then rounded again.  Some information is lost in
translation.  \index{height} \index{weight} \index{jitter}

We can't get that information back, but we can minimize the effect on
the scatter plot by {\bf jittering} the data, which means adding random
noise to reverse the effect of rounding off.  Since these measurements
were rounded to the nearest inch, they might be off by up to 0.5 inches or
1.3 cm.  Similarly, the weights might be off by 0.5 kg.
\index{uniform distribution}
\index{distribution!uniform}
\index{noise}
%
\begin{verbatim}
    heights = thinkstats2.Jitter(heights, 1.3)
    weights = thinkstats2.Jitter(weights, 0.5)
\end{verbatim}

Here's the implementation of {\tt Jitter}:

\begin{verbatim}
def Jitter(values, jitter=0.5):
    n = len(values)
    return np.random.uniform(-jitter, +jitter, n) + values
\end{verbatim}

The values can be any sequence; the result is a NumPy array.

Figure~\ref{scatter1} (right) shows the result.  Jittering reduces the
visual effect of rounding and makes the shape of the relationship
clearer.  But in general you should only jitter data for purposes of
visualization and avoid using jittered data for analysis.

Even with jittering, this is not the best way to represent the data.
There are many overlapping points, which hides data
in the dense parts of the figure and gives disproportionate emphasis
to outliers.  This effect is called {\bf saturation}.
\index{outlier}

We can solve this problem with the {\tt alpha} parameter, which makes
the points partly transparent:
%
\begin{verbatim}
    thinkplot.Scatter(heights, weights, alpha=0.2)
\end{verbatim}
%
Figure~\ref{scatter2} (left) shows the result.  Overlapping data
points look darker, so darkness is proportional to density.  In this
version of the plot we can two details that were not apparent before:
vertical clusters at several heights and a horizontal line near 90 kg
or 200 pounds.  Since this data is based on self-reports in pounds,
the most likely explanation is that some respondents reported
rounded values.

Using transparency works well for moderate-sized datasets, but this
figure only shows the first 5000 records in the BRFSS, out of a total
of 414 509.
\index{hexbin plot}
\index{plot!hexbin}

To handle larger datasets, another option is a hexbin plot, which
divides the graph into hexagonal bins and colors each bin according to
how many data points fall in it.  {\tt thinkplot} provides 
{\tt HexBin}:
%
\begin{verbatim}
    thinkplot.HexBin(heights, weights)
\end{verbatim}
%
Figure~\ref{scatter2} (right) shows the result.  An advantage of a
hexbin is that it shows the shape of the relationship well, and it is
efficient for large datasets, but in time and in the size of the file
it generates.  A drawback is that it makes the outliers invisible.

The moral of this story is that it is
not easy to make a scatter plot that shows relationships clearly
without introducing misleading artifacts.


\section{Characterizing relationships}
\label{characterizing}

Scatter plots provide a general impression of the relationship
between variables, but there are other visualizations that provide
more insight into the nature of the relationship.  One option is
to use one variable to bin the data and plot percentiles of the
other variable.

NumPy and pandas provide functions for binning data:

\begin{verbatim}
    df = df.dropna(subset=['htm3', 'wtkg2'])
    bins = np.arange(135, 210, 5)
    indices = np.digitize(df.htm3, bins)
    groups = df.groupby(indices)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt dropna} drops rows with {\tt nan} in any of the columns
listed in {\tt subset}.

{\tt arange} makes a NumPy array of bins from 135 to, but not including,
210, in increments of 5.

{\tt digitize} computes the index of the bin that contains each value
in {\tt df.htm3}.  The result is a NumPy array of integer indices.
Values that fall below the lowest bin are mapped to index 0.  Values
above the highest bin are mapped to {\tt len(bins)}.  So
{\tt indices} is one element longer than {\tt bins}.

\begin{figure}
% scatter.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/scatter3.pdf}}
\caption{Percentiles of weight for a range of height bins.}
\label{scatter3}
\end{figure}

{\tt groupby} is a pandas method that divides a DataFrame into groups.
The result is an object that iterates over the groups.  So, for example,
we can print the number of rows in each group:

\begin{verbatim}
for i, group in groups:
    print(i, len(group))
\end{verbatim}

Now for each group we can compute the mean height and the CDF
of weight:

\begin{verbatim}
    heights = [group.htm3.mean() for i, group in groups][1:-1]
    cdfs = [thinkstats2.Cdf(group.wtkg2) for i, group in groups][1:-1]
\end{verbatim}

The slice operators omit the first and last groups, which contain
the values that fall outside the range of bins.  Finally, we can
plot percentiles of weight versus height:

\begin{verbatim}
    for percent in [75, 50, 25]:
        weights = [cdf.Percentile(percent) for cdf in cdfs]
        label = '%dth' % percent
        thinkplot.Plot(heights, weights, label=label)
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{scatter3} shows the result.  Between 140 and 200 cm
the relationship between these variables is linear.  This range
includes more than 99\% of the data, so we don't have to worry
too much about the extremes.


\section{Correlation}

A {\bf correlation} is a statistic intended to quantify the strength
of the relationship between two variables.
\index{correlation}

A challenge in measuring correlation is that the variables we want to
compare are often not expressed in the same units.  And even if they
are in the same units, they come from different distributions.
\index{units}

There are two common solutions to these problems:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Transform all values to {\bf standard scores}.  This leads to
the ``Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient.''
\index{standard scores}
\index{Pearson coefficient of correlation}
\index{Spearman coefficient of correlation}
\index{coefficient!correlation}

\item Transform all values to their percentile ranks.  This
leads to the ``Spearman rank correlation coefficient.''
\index{rank}
\index{percentile rank}

\end{enumerate}

If $X$ is a series of values, $x_i$, we can convert to standard
scores by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation:
$z_i = (x_i - \mu) / \sigma$.
\index{mean}
\index{standard deviation}

The numerator is a deviation: the distance from the mean.  Dividing by
$\sigma$ {\bf standardizes} the deviation, so the values of $Z$ are
dimensionless (no units) and their distribution has mean 0 and
variance 1.
\index{standardize}
\index{deviation}
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

If $X$ is normally distributed, so is $Z$; but if $X$ is skewed or has
outliers, so does $Z$.  In that case it is more robust to use
percentile ranks.  If we compute a new variable, $R$, so that $r_i$ is
the percentile rank of $x_i$, the distribution of $R$ is uniform
between 0 and 100, regardless of the distribution of $X$.
\index{uniform distribution} \index{distribution!uniform}
\index{robust}


\section{Covariance}
\index{covariance}
\index{deviation}

{\bf Covariance} is a measure of the tendency of two variables
to vary together.  If we have two series, $X$ and $Y$, their
deviations from the mean are
%
\[ dx_i = x_i - \xbar \]
%
\[ dy_i = y_i - \ybar \]
%
where $\xbar$ is the sample mean of $X$ and $\ybar$ is the sample mean
of $Y$.  If $X$ and $Y$ vary together, their deviations tend to have
the same sign.

If we multiply them together, the product is positive when the
deviations have the same sign and negative when they have the opposite
sign.  So adding up the products gives a measure of the tendency to
vary together.

Covariance is the mean of these products:
%
\[ Cov(X,Y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum dx_i dy_i \]
%
where $n$ is the length of the two series (they have to be the same
length).

If you have studied linear algebra, you might recognize that
{\tt Cov} is the dot product of the deviations, divided
by their length.  So the covariance is maximized if the two vectors
are identical, 0 if they are othogonal, and negative if they
point in opposite directions.  {\tt thinkstats2} uses {\tt np.dot} to
implement {\tt Cov} efficiently:

\begin{verbatim}
def Cov(xs, ys, meanx=None, meany=None):
    if meanx is None:
        meanx = np.mean(xs)
    if meany is None:
        meany = np.mean(ys)

    cov = np.dot(np.asarray(xs)-meanx, np.asarray(ys)-meany) / len(xs)
    return cov
\end{verbatim}

By default {\tt Cov} computes deviations from the sample means,
or you can provide known values.  If {\tt xs} and {\tt ys} are
Python sequences, {\tt np.asarray} converts them to NumPy arrays.
If they are already NumPy arrays, {\tt np.asarray} does nothing.

This implementation of covariance is meant to be simple for purposes
of explanation.  NumPy and pandas also provide implementations of
covariance, but both of them apply a correction for small sample sizes
that we have not covered yet, and {\tt np.cov} returns a covariance
matrix, which is more than we need for now.


\section{Pearson's correlation}
\index{correlation}
\index{standard score}

Covariance is useful in some computations, but it is seldom reported
as a summary statistic because it is hard to interpret.  Among other
problems, its units are the product of the units of $X$ and $Y$.  For
example, the covariance of weight and height in the BRFSS dataset is
113 kilogram-centimeters, whatever that means.

One solution to this problem is to divide the deviations by the standard
deviation, which yields standard scores, and compute the product of
standard scores:
%
\[ p_i = \frac{(x_i - \xbar)}{S_X} \frac{(y_i - \ybar)}{S_Y} \]
%
Where $S_X$ and $S_Y$ are the standard deviations of $X$ and $Y$.
The mean of these products is
%
\[ \rho = \frac{1}{n} \sum p_i \]
%
Or we can rewrite $\rho$ by factoring out $S_X$ and
$S_Y$:
%
\[ \rho = \frac{Cov(X,Y)}{S_X S_Y} \]
%
This value is called {\bf Pearson's correlation} after Karl Pearson,
an influential early statistician.  It is easy to compute and easy to
interpret.  Because standard scores are dimensionless, so is $\rho$.
\index{Pearson, Karl}
\index{Pearson coefficient of correlation}
\index{coefficient!correlation}

Here is the implementation in {\tt thinkstats2}:

\begin{verbatim}
def Corr(xs, ys):
    xs = np.asarray(xs)
    ys = np.asarray(ys)

    meanx, varx = MeanVar(xs)
    meany, vary = MeanVar(ys)

    corr = Cov(xs, ys, meanx, meany) / math.sqrt(varx * vary)
    return corr
\end{verbatim}

{\tt MeanVar} computes mean and variance slightly more efficiently
than separate calls to {\tt np.mean} and {\tt np.var}.

Pearson's correlation is always between -1 and +1 (including both).
If $\rho$ is positive, we say that the correlation is positive,
which means that when one variable is high, the other tends to be
high.  If $\rho$ is negative, the correlation is negative, so
when one variable is high, the other is low.

The magnitude of $\rho$ indicates the strength of the correlation.  If
$\rho$ is 1 or -1, the variables are perfectly correlated, which means
that if you know one, you can make a perfect prediction about the
other.  \index{prediction}

Most correlation in the real world is not perfect, but it is still
useful.  The correlation of height and weight is 0.51, which is a
strong correlation compared to similar human-related variables.  In
Section~\ref{goodness} I will say more about how to interpret
correlations.


\section{Non-linear relationships}

If Pearson's correlation is near 0, it is tempting to conclude
that there is no relationship between the variables, but that
conclusion is not valid.  Pearson's correlation only measures {\em
  linear} relationships.  If there's a nonlinear relationship, $\rho$
understates its strength.  \index{linear relationship}

\begin{figure}
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/Correlation_examples.png}}
\caption{Examples of datasets with a range of correlations.}
\label{corr_examples}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{corr_examples} is from
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence}.  It shows
scatter plots and correlation coefficients for several
carefully-constructed datasets.
\index{coefficient!correlation}
\index{scatter plot}
\index{plot!scatter}

The top row shows linear relationships with a range of correlations;
you can use this row to get a sense of what different values of
$\rho$ look like.  The second row shows perfect correlations with a
range of slopes, which demonstrates that correlation is unrelated to
slope (we'll talk about estimating slope soon).  The third row shows
variables that are clearly related, but because the relationship is
non-linear, the correlation coefficient is 0.

The moral of this story is that you should always look at a scatter
plot of your data before blindly computing a correlation coefficient.
\index{correlation coefficient} \index{coefficient!correlation}


\section{Spearman's rank correlation}

Pearson's correlation works well if the relationship between variables
is linear and if the variables are roughly normal.  But it is not
robust in the presence of outliers.
\index{Pearson coefficient of correlation}
\index{Spearman coefficient of correlation}
\index{coefficient!correlation}
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

Anscombe's quartet demonstrates this effect; it contains four data
sets with the same correlation.  One is a linear relation with random
noise, one is a non-linear relation, one is a perfect relation with an
outlier, and one has no relation except an artifact caused by an
outlier.  You can read more about it at
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Anscombe's_quartet}.
\index{Anscombe's quartet}

Spearman's rank correlation is an alternative that mitigates the
effect of outliers and skewed distributions.  To compute Spearman's
correlation, we have to compute the {\bf rank} of each value, which is its
index in the sorted sample.  For example, in the sample {\tt [1, 2, 5, 7]}
the rank of the value 5 is 3, because it appears third in the sorted
list.  Then we compute Pearson's correlation for the ranks.

{\tt thinkstats2} provides a function that computes Spearman's rank
correlation:

\begin{verbatim}
def SpearmanCorr(xs, ys):
    xranks = pandas.Series(xs).rank()
    yranks = pandas.Series(ys).rank()
    return Corr(xranks, yranks)
\end{verbatim}

I convert the arguments to pandas Series objects so I can use
{\tt rank}, which computes the rank for each value and returns
a Series.  Then I use {\tt Corr} to compute the 

Or I could use {\tt Series.corr} directly and specify
Spearman's method:

\begin{verbatim}
def SpearmanCorr(xs, ys):
    xranks = pandas.Series(xs)
    yranks = pandas.Series(ys)
    return xs.corr(ys, method='spearman')
\end{verbatim}

The Spearman rank correlation for the BRFSS data is 0.54, a little
higher than the Pearson correlation, 0.51.  There are several possible
reasons for the difference, including:

\begin{itemize}

\item If the relationship is
nonlinear, Pearson's correlation tends to underestimate the strength
of the relationship, and 

\item Pearson's correlation can affected (in either direction)
if one of the distributions is skewed or contains outliers.  Spearman's
rank correlation is immune to these effects.

\end{itemize}

In the BRFSS example, we know that the distribution of weights is
roughly lognormal, so we could eliminate the effect of skewness
by computing Pearson's
correlation between height and the log of weight.
\index{lognormal distribution}
\index{distribution!lognormal}

\begin{verbatim}
    thinkstats2.Corr(df.htm3, np.log(df.wtkg2)))
\end{verbatim}

The result is 0.53, close to the rank correlation, 0.54.  So that
suggests that skewness in the distribution of weight explains most of
the difference between Pearson's and Spearman's correlation.


\section{Correlation and causation}
\index{correlation}
\index{causation}

If variables A and B are related, there are three possible
explanations: A causes B, or B causes A, or some other set of factors
causes both A and B.  These explanations are called ``causal
relationships''.

Correlation alone does not distinguish between these explanations,
so it does not tell you which ones are true.
This rule is often summarized with the phrase ``Correlation
does not imply causation,'' which is so pithy it has its own
Wikipedia page: \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation}.

So what can you do to provide evidence of causation?

\begin{enumerate}

\item Use time.  If A comes before B, then A can cause B but not the
  other way around (at least according to our common understanding of
  causation).  The order of events can help us infer the direction
  of causation, but it does not preclude the possibility that something
  else causes both A and B.

\item Use randomness.  If you divide a large sample into two
  groups at random and compute the means of almost any variable, you
  expect the difference to be small.
  If the groups are nearly identical in all variable but one, you
  can eliminate spurious relationships.
  \index{spurious relationship}

  This works even if you don't know what the relevant variables
  are, but it works even better if you do, because you can check that
  the groups are identical.

\end{enumerate}

These ideas are the motivation for the {\bf randomized controlled
trial}, in which subjects are assigned randomly to two (or more)
groups: a {\bf treatment group} that receives some kind of intervention,
like a new medicine, and a {\bf control group} that receives
no intervention, or another treatment whose effects are known.
\index{randomized controlled trial}
\index{controlled trial}
\index{treatment group}
\index{control group}
\index{medicine}

A randomized controlled trial is the most reliable way to demonstrate
a causal relationship, and the foundation of science-based medicine
(see \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial}).

Unfortunately, controlled trials are only possible in the laboratory
sciences, medicine, and a few other disciplines.  In the social sciences,
controlled experiments are rare, usually because they are impossible
or unethical.

An alternative is to look for a {\bf natural experiment}, where
different ``treatments'' are applied to groups that are otherwise
similar.  One danger of natural experiments is that the groups might
differ in ways that are not apparent.  You can read more about this
topic at \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment}.
\index{natural experiment}

In some cases it is possible to infer causal relationships using {\bf
  regression analysis}, which is the topic of Chapter~\ref{regression}.
\index{regression analysis}

\chapter{Estimation}
\label{estimation}
\index{estimation}

The code for this chapter is in {\tt estimation.py}.  For information
about downloading and working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.


\section{The estimation game}

Let's play a game.  I'll think of a distribution, and you have to guess
what it is.  I'll give you two hints; it's a
normal distribution, and here's a random sample drawn from it:
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

{\tt [-0.441, 1.774, -0.101, -1.138, 2.975, -2.138]}

What do you think is the mean parameter, $\mu$, of this distribution?
\index{mean}
\index{parameter}

One choice is to use the sample mean, $\xbar$, as an estimate of $\mu$.
In this example, $\xbar$ is 0.155, so it would
be reasonable to guess $\mu$ = 0.155.
This process is called {\bf estimation}, and the statistic we used
(the sample mean) is called an {\bf estimator}.
\index{estimator}

Using the sample mean to estimate $\mu$ is so obvious that it is hard
to imagine a reasonable alternative.  But suppose we change the game by
introducing outliers.
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

{\em I'm thinking of a distribution.}  It's a normal distribution, and
here's a sample that was collected by an unreliable surveyor who
occasionally puts the decimal point in the wrong place.

{\tt [-0.441, 1.774, -0.101, -1.138, 2.975, -213.8]}

Now what's your estimate of $\mu$?  If you use the sample mean, your
guess is -35.12.  Is that the best choice?  What are the alternatives?
\index{outlier}

One option is to identify and discard outliers, then compute the sample
mean of the rest.  Another option is to use the median as an estimator.
\index{median}

Which estimator is best depends on the circumstances (for example,
whether there are outliers) and on what the goal is.  Are you
trying to minimize errors, or maximize your chance of getting the
right answer?
\index{error}
\index{MSE}
\index{mean squared error}

If there are no outliers, the sample mean minimizes the {\bf mean squared
error} (MSE).  That is, if we play the game many times, and each time
compute the error $\xbar - \mu$, the sample mean minimizes
%
\[ MSE = \frac{1}{m} \sum (\xbar - \mu)^2 \]
%
Where $m$ is the number of times you play the estimation game, not
to be confused with $n$, which is the size of the sample used to
compute $\xbar$.

Here is a function that simulates the estimation game and computes
the root mean squared error (RMSE), which is the square root of
MSE:

\begin{verbatim}
def Estimate1(n=7, m=1000):
    mu = 0
    sigma = 1

    means = []
    medians = []
    for _ in range(m):
        xs = [random.gauss(mu, sigma) for i in range(n)]
        xbar = np.mean(xs)
        median = np.median(xs)
        means.append(xbar)
        medians.append(median)

    print('rmse xbar', RMSE(means, mu))
    print('rmse median', RMSE(medians, mu))
\end{verbatim}

Again, {\tt n} is the size of the sample, and {\tt m} is the
number of times we play the game.  {\tt means} is the list of
estimates based on $\xbar$.  {\tt medians} is the list of medians.

Here's the function that computes RMSE:

\begin{verbatim}
def RMSE(estimates, actual):
    e2 = [(estimate-actual)**2 for estimate in estimates]
    mse = np.mean(e2)
    return math.sqrt(mse)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt estimates} is a list of estimates; {\tt actual} is the
actual value being estimated.  In practice, of course, we don't
know {\tt actual}; if we did, we wouldn't have to estimate it.
The purpose of this experiment is to compare the performance of
the two estimators.

When I ran this code, the RMSE of the sample mean was 0.41, which
means that if we use $\xbar$ to estimate the mean of this
distribution, based on a sample with $n=7$, we should expect to be off
by 0.41 on average.  Using the median to estimate the mean yields
RMSE 0.53, which confirms that $\xbar$ yields lower RMSE, at least
for this example.

Minimizing MSE is a nice property, but it's not always the best
strategy.  For example, suppose we are estimating the distribution of
wind speeds at a building site.  If the estimate is too high, we might
overbuild the structure, increasing its cost.  But if it's too
low, the building might collapse.  Because cost as a function of
error is not symmetric, minimizing MSE is not the best strategy.
\index{prediction}

As another example, suppose I roll three six-sided dice and ask you to
predict the total.  If you get it exactly right, you get a prize;
otherwise you get nothing.  In this case the value that minimizes MSE
is 10.5, but that would be a bad guess, because the total of three
dice is never 10.5.  For this game, you want an estimator that has the
highest chance of being right, which is a {\bf maximum likelihood
  estimator} (MLE).  If you pick 10 or 11, your chance of winning is 1
in 8, and that's the best you can do.  \index{MLE} \index{maximum
  likelihood estimator}


\section{Guess the variance}
\index{variance}
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

{\em I'm thinking of a distribution.}  It's a normal distribution, and 
here's a (familiar) sample:

{\tt [-0.441, 1.774, -0.101, -1.138, 2.975, -2.138]}

What do you think is the variance, $\sigma^2$, of my distribution?
Again, the obvious choice is to use the sample variance, $S^2$, as an
estimator.
%
\[ S^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum (x_i - \xbar)^2 \] 
%
For large samples, $S^2$ is an adequate estimator, but for small
samples it tends to be too low.  Because of this unfortunate
property, it is called a {\bf biased} estimator.
An estimator is {\bf unbiased} if the expected total (or mean) error,
after many iterations of the estimation game, is 0.
\index{sample variance}
\index{biased estimator}
\index{estimator!biased}
\index{unbiased estimator}
\index{estimator!unbiased}

Fortunately, there is another simple statistic that is an unbiased
estimator of $\sigma^2$:
%
\[ S_{n-1}^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum (x_i - \xbar)^2 \] 
%
For an explanation of why $S^2$ is biased, and a proof that
$S_{n-1}^2$ is unbiased, see
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_an_estimator}.

The biggest problem with this estimator is that its name and symbol
are used inconsistently.  The name ``sample variance'' can refer to
either $S^2$ or $S_{n-1}^2$, and the symbol $S^2$ is used
for either or both.

Here is a function that simulates the estimation game and tests
the performance of $S^2$ and $S_{n-1}^2$:

\begin{verbatim}
def Estimate2(n=7, m=1000):
    mu = 0
    sigma = 1

    estimates1 = []
    estimates2 = []
    for _ in range(m):
        xs = [random.gauss(mu, sigma) for i in range(n)]
        biased = np.var(xs)
        unbiased = np.var(xs, ddof=1)
        estimates1.append(biased)
        estimates2.append(unbiased)

    print('mean error biased', MeanError(estimates1, sigma**2))
    print('mean error unbiased', MeanError(estimates2, sigma**2))
\end{verbatim}

Again, {\tt n} is the sample size and {\tt m} is the number of times
we play the game.  {\tt np.var} computes $S^2$ by default and
$S_{n-1}^2$ if you provide the argument {\tt ddof=1}, which stands for
``delta degrees of freedom.''  I won't explain that now, but you can read
about it at
\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)}.

{\tt MeanError} computes the mean difference between the estimates
and the actual value:

\begin{verbatim}
def MeanError(estimates, actual):
    errors = [estimate-actual for estimate in estimates]
    return np.mean(errors)
\end{verbatim}

When I ran this code, the mean error for $S^2$ was -0.13.  As
expected, this biased estimator tends to be too low.  For $S_{n-1}^2$,
the mean error was 0.014, about 10 times smaller.  As {\tt m}
increases, we expect the mean error for $S_{n-1}^2$ to approach 0.

Properties like MSE and bias are long-term expectations based on
many iterations of the estimation game.  By running simulations like
the ones in this chapter, we can compare estimators and check whether
they have desired properties.

But when you apply an estimator to real
data, you just get one estimate.  It would not be meaningful to say
that the estimate is unbiased; being unbiased is a property of the
estimator, not the estimate.

If you choose an estimator with appropriate properties, and use it to
generate an estimate, the next step is to characterize the
uncertainty of the estimate, which is the topic of the next
section.


\section{Sampling distributions}

Suppose you are a scientist studying gorillas in a wildlife
preserve.  You want to know the average weight of the adult
female gorillas in the preserve.  To weigh them, you have
to tranquilize them, which is dangerous, expensive, and possibly
harmful to the gorillas.  But if it is important to obtain this
information, it might be acceptable to weigh a sample of 9
gorillas.  Let's assume that the population of the preserve is
well known, so we can choose a representative sample of adult
females.  We could use the sample mean, $\xbar$, to estimate the
unknown population mean, $\mu$.

Having weighed 9 female gorillas, you might find $\xbar=90$ kg and
sample standard deviation, $S=7.5$ kg.  The sample mean, $\xbar=90$,
is an unbiased estimator of $\mu$, and in the long run it
minimizes MSE.  So if you reported a single
estimate that summarizes the results, you would report 90 kg.

But how confident should you be in this estimate?  If you only weigh
$n=9$ gorillas out of a much larger population, you might be unlucky
and choose the 9 heaviest gorillas (or the 9 lightest ones) just by
chance.  Variation in the estimate caused by random selection is
called {\bf sampling error}.

To quantify sampling error, we can simulate the
sampling process with hypothetical values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$, and
see how much $\xbar$ varies.

Since we don't know the actual values of 
$\mu$ and $\sigma$ in the population, we'll use the estimates
$\xbar$ and $S$.
So the question we answer is:
``If the actual values of $\mu$ and $\sigma$ were 90 kg and 7.5 kg,
and we ran the same experiment many times, how much would the
estimated mean, $\xbar$, vary?''

The following function answers that question:

\begin{verbatim}
def SimulateSample(mu=90, sigma=7.5, n=9, m=1000):
    means = []
    for j in range(m):
        xs = np.random.normal(mu, sigma, n)
        xbar = np.mean(xs)
        means.append(xbar)

    cdf = thinkstats2.MakeCdfFromList(means)
    ci = cdf.Percentile(5), cdf.Percentile(95)
    stderr = RMSE(means, mu)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt mu} and {\tt sigma} are the {\em hypothetical} values of
the parameters.  {\tt n} is the sample size, the number of
gorillas we measured.  {\tt m} is the number of times we run
the simulation.

\begin{figure}
% estimation.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/estimation1.pdf}}
\caption{Sampling distribution of $\xbar$, with confidence interval.}
\label{estimation1}
\end{figure}

In each iteration, we choose {\tt n} values from a normal
distribution with the given parameters, and compute the sample mean,
{\tt xbar}.  We run 1000 simulations and then compute the
distribution, {\tt cdf}, of the estimates.  The result is shown in
Figure~\ref{estimation1}.  This distribution is called the {\bf
  sampling distribution} of the estimator.  It shows how much the
estimates would vary if we ran the experiment over and over.

The mean of the sampling distribution is pretty close
to the hypothetical value of $\mu$, which means that the experiment
yields the right answer, on average.  After 1000 tries, the lowest
result is 82 kg, and the highest is 98 kg.  This range suggests that
the estimate might be off by as much as 8 kg.

There are two common ways to summarize the sampling distribution:

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Standard error} (SE) is a measure of how far we expect the
  estimate to be off, on average.  For each simulated experiment, we
  compute the error, $\xbar - \mu$, and then compute the root mean
  squared error (RMSE).  In this example, it is roughly 2.5 kg.

\item A {\bf confidence interval} (CI) is a range that includes a
  given fraction of the sampling distribution.  For example, the 90\%
  confidence interval is the range from the 5th to the 95th
  percentile.  In this example, the 90\% CI is $(86, 94)$ kg.

\end{itemize}

Standard errors and confidence intervals are the source of much confusion:

\begin{itemize}

\item People often confuse standard error and standard deviation.
  Remember that standard deviation describes variability in a measured
  quantity; in this example, the standard deviation of gorilla weight
  is 7.5 kg.  Standard error describes variability in an estimate.  In
  this example, the standard error of the mean, based on a sample of 9
  measurements, is 2.5 kg.

One way to remember the difference is that, as sample size increases,
standard error gets smaller; standard deviation does not.

\item People often think that there is a 90\% probability that the
  actual parameter, $\mu$, falls in the 90\% confidence interval.
  Sadly, that is not true.  If you want to make a claim like that, you
  have to use Bayesian methods (see my book, {\it Think Bayes}).

\end{itemize}

The sampling distribution answers a different question:
it gives you a sense of how reliable an estimate
is by telling you how much it would vary if you ran the experiment
again.

It is important to remember that confidence intervals
and standard errors only quantify sampling error; that is,
error due to measuring only part of the population.
The sampling distribution does not account for other
sources of error, notably sampling bias and measurement error, 
which are the topics of the next section.


\section{Sampling bias}

Suppose that instead of the weight of gorillas in a nature preserve,
you want to know the average weight of women in the city where you
live.  It is unlikely that you would be allowed
to choose a representative sample of women and
weigh them.

A simple alternative would be
``telephone sampling;'' that is,
you could choose random numbers from the phone book, call and ask to
speak to an adult woman, and ask how much she weighs.

Telephone sampling has obvious limitations.  For example, the sample
is limited to people whose telephone numbers are listed, so it
eliminates people without phones (who might be poorer than average)
and people with unlisted numbers (who might be richer).  Also, if you
call home telephones during the day, you are less likely to sample
people with jobs.  And if you only sample the person who answers the
phone, you are less likely to sample people who share a phone number
with other women.

If factors like income, employment, and household size are related
to weight (and it is plausible that they are), the results of your
survey will be affected one way or another.  This problem is
called {\bf sampling bias} because it is a property of the sampling
process.

This sampling process is also vulnerable to self-selection, which is a
kind of sampling bias.  Some people will refuse to answer the
question, and if the tendency to refuse is related to weight, that
will affect the results.

Finally, if you ask people how much they weigh, rather than weighing
them, the results might not be accurate.  Even helpful respondents
might round up or down if they are uncomfortable with their actual
weight.  And not all respondents are helpful.  These inaccuracies are
examples of {\bf measurement error}.

When you report an estimated quantity, it is useful to report
standard error, or a confidence interval, or both, in order to
quantify sampling error.  But it is also important to remember that
sampling error is only one source of error, and often it is not the
biggest.


\section{Exponential distributions}
\index{exponential distribution}
\index{distribution!exponential}

Let's play one more round of the estimation game.
{\em I'm thinking of a distribution.}  It's an exponential distribution, and 
here's a sample:

{\tt [5.384, 4.493, 19.198, 2.790, 6.122, 12.844]}

What do you think is the parameter, $\lambda$, of this distribution?
\index{parameter}
\index{mean}

\newcommand{\lamhat}{L}
\newcommand{\lamhatmed}{L_m}

In general, the mean of an exponential distribution is $1/\lambda$,
so working backwards, we might choose
%
\[ \lamhat = 1 / \xbar\]
%
$\lamhat$ is an
estimator of $\lambda$.  And not just any estimator; it is also the
maximum likelihood estimator\footnote{See
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution#Maximum_likelihood}.}.
So if you want to maximize your chance of guessing $\lambda$ exactly,
$\lamhat$ is the way to go.
\index{MLE}
\index{maximum likelihood estimator}

But we know that $\xbar$ is not robust in the presence of outliers, so
we expect $\lamhat$ to have the same problem.
\index{robust}
\index{outlier}

We can choose an alternative based on the sample median.
The median of an exponential distribution is $\ln(2) / \lambda$,
so working backwards again, we can define an estimator
%
\[ \lamhatmed = \ln(2) / m \]
%
where $m$ is the sample median.
\index{median}

To test the performance of these estimators, we can simulate the
sampling process:

\begin{verbatim}
def Estimate3(n=7, m=1000):
    lam = 2

    means = []
    medians = []
    for _ in range(m):
        xs = np.random.exponential(1.0/lam, n)
        L = 1 / np.mean(xs)
        Lm = math.log(2) / thinkstats2.Median(xs)
        means.append(L)
        medians.append(Lm)

    print('rmse L', RMSE(means, lam))
    print('rmse Lm', RMSE(medians, lam))
    print('mean error L', MeanError(means, lam))
    print('mean error Lm', MeanError(medians, lam))
\end{verbatim}

When I ran this experiment with $\lambda=2$, I found the RMSE of $L$ is 
1.1.  For the median-based estimator $L_m$, RMSE is 1.8.  We can't
tell from this experiment whether $L$ minimized MSE, but at least
it seems better than $L_m$.

Sadly, it seems that both estimators are biased.  For $L$ the mean
error is 0.33, for $L_m$ it is 0.45.  And neither converges to 0
as {\tt m} increases.

It turns out that $\xbar$ is an unbiased estimator of the mean
of the distribution, $1 / \lambda$, but $L$ is not an unbiased
estimator of $\lambda$.


\section{Exercises}

For the following exercises, you might want to start with
{\tt estimation.py}.  

\begin{exercise}

In this chapter we used $\xbar$ and median to estimate $\mu$, and
found that $\xbar$  yields lower MSE.
Also, we used $S^2$ and $S_{n-1}^2$ to estimate $\sigma$, and found that
$S^2$ is biased and $S_{n-1}^2$ unbiased.

Run similar experiments to see if $\xbar$ and median are biased estimates
of $\mu$.
Also check whether $S^2$ or $S_{n-1}^2$ yields a lower MSE.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Suppose you draw a sample with size $n=10$ from a population 
with an exponential distribution with $\lambda=2$.  Simulate
this experiment 1000 times and plot the sampling distribution of
the estimate $\lamhat$.  Compute the standard error of the estimate
and the 90\% confidence interval.

Repeat the experiment with a few different values of $n$ and make
a plot of standard error versus $n$.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

In games like hockey and soccer, the time between goals is
roughly exponential.  So you could estimate a team's goal-scoring rate
by observing the number of goals they score in a game.  This
estimation process is a little different from sampling the time
between goals, so let's see how it works.

Write a function that takes a goal-scoring rate, {\tt lam}, in goals
per game, and simulates a game by generating the time between goals
until the total time exceeds 1 game, then returns the number of goals
scored.

Write another function that simulates many games, stores the
estimates of {\tt lam}, then computes their mean error and RMSE.

Is this way of making an estimate biased?  Plot the sampling
distribution of the estimates and the 90\% confidence interval.  What
is the standard error?  What happens to sampling error for increasing
values of {\tt lam}?

\end{exercise}

\chapter{Hypothesis testing}
\label{testing}

The code for this chapter is in {\tt hypothesis.py}.  For information
about downloading and working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.

\section{Classical hypothesis testing}
\index{hypothesis testing}
\index{apparent effect}

Exploring the data from the NSFG, we saw several ``apparent effects,''
including differences between first babies and others.
So far we have taken these effects at face value; in this chapter,
we put them to the test.
\index{National Survey of Family Growth}
\index{NSFG}

The fundamental question we want to address is whether the effects
we see in a sample are likely to appear in the larger population.
For example, in the NSFG sample we see a difference in mean pregnancy
length for first babies and others.  We would like to know if
that effect reflects a real difference for women
in the U.S., or if it might appear in the sample by chance.
\index{pregnancy length} \index{length!pregnancy}

There are several ways we could formulate this question, including
Fisher null hypothesis testing, Neyman-Pearson decision theory, and
Bayesian inference\footnote{For more about Bayesian inference, see the
  sequel to this book, {\it Think Bayes}.}.  What I present here is a
subset of all three that makes up most of what people use in practice,
which I will call {\bf classical hypothesis testing}.

The goal of classical hypothesis testing is to answer the question,
``Given a sample and an apparent effect, what is the probability of
seeing such an effect by chance?''  Here's how we answer that question:

\begin{itemize}

\item The first step is to quantify the size of the apparent effect by
  choosing a {\bf test statistic}.  In the NSFG example, the apparent
  effect is a difference in pregnancy length between first babies and
  others, so a natural choice for the test statistic is the difference
  in means between the two groups.
  \index{test statistic}

\item The second step is to define a {\bf null hypothesis}, which is a
  model of the system based on the assumption that the apparent effect
  is not real.  In the NSFG example the null hypothesis is that there
  is no difference between first babies and others; that is, that
  pregnancy lengths for both groups have the same distribution.
  \index{null hypothesis}

\item The third step is to compute a {\bf p-value}, which is the
  probability of seeing the apparent effect if the null hypothesis is
  true.  In the NSFG example, we would compute the actual difference
  in means, then compute the probability of seeing a
  difference as big, or bigger, under the null hypothesis.
  \index{p-value}

\item The last step is to interpret the result.  If the p-value is
  low, the effect is said to be {\bf statistically significant}, which
  means that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance.  In that case
  we infer that the effect is more likely to appear in the larger
  population.  \index{statistically significant} \index{significant}

\end{itemize}

The logic of this process is similar to a proof by
contradiction.  To prove a mathematical statement, A, you assume
temporarily that A is false.  If that assumption leads to a
contradiction, you conclude that A must actually be true.
\index{contradiction, proof by}

Similarly, to test a hypothesis like, ``This effect is real,'' we
assume, temporarily, that is is not.  That's the null hypothesis.
Based on that assumption, we compute the probability of the apparent
effect.  That's the p-value.  If the p-value is low enough, we
conclude that the null hypothesis is unlikely to be true.


\section{HypothesisTest}
\index{mean, difference in}

{\tt thinkstats2} provides {\tt HypothesisTest}, a
class that represents the structure of a classical hypothesis
test.  Here is the definition:

\begin{verbatim}
class HypothesisTest(object):

    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.MakeModel()
        self.actual = self.TestStatistic(data)

    def PValue(self, iters=1000):
        self.test_stats = [self.TestStatistic(self.RunModel()) 
                           for _ in range(iters)]

        count = sum(1 for x in self.test_stats if x >= self.actual)
        return count / iters

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        raise UnimplementedMethodException()

    def MakeModel(self):
        pass

    def RunModel(self):
        raise UnimplementedMethodException()
\end{verbatim}

{\tt HypothesisTest} is an abstract parent class that provides
complete definitions for some methods, and place-keepers for others.
Child classes based on {\tt HypothesisTest} inherit \verb"__init__"
and {\tt PValue} and provide implementations for {\tt TestStatistic},
{\tt RunModel}, and optionally {\tt MakeModel}.

\verb"__init__" takes the data in whatever form is appropriate.  It
calls {\tt RunModel}, which builds a representation of the null
hypothesis, then passes the data to {\tt TestStatistic}, which
computes the size of the effect in the sample.

{\tt PValue} computes the probability of the apparent effect under
the null hypothesis.  It takes as a parameter {\tt iters}, which is
the number of simulations to run.  The first line generates simulated
data, computes test statistics, and stored them in
\verb"test_stats".
The result is
the fraction of elements in \verb"test_stats" that
exceed or equal the observed test statistic, {\tt self.actual}.

As a simple example\footnote{Adapted from MacKay, {\it Information
    Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms}, 2003.}, suppose we
toss a coin 250 times and see 140 heads and 110 tails.  Based on this
result, we might suspect that the coin is biased; that is, more likely
to land heads.  To test this hypothesis, we compute the
probability of seeing such a big difference if the coin is actually
fair:

\begin{verbatim}
class CoinTest(thinkstats2.HypothesisTest):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        heads, tails = data
        test_stat = abs(heads - tails)
        return test_stat

    def RunModel(self):
        heads, tails = self.data
        n = heads + tails
        sample = [random.choice('HT') for _ in range(n)]
        hist = thinkstats2.Hist(sample)
        data = hist['H'], hist['T']
        return data
\end{verbatim}

The parameter, {\tt data}, is a pair
integers: the number of heads and tails.  The test statistic is
the absolute difference between them, so {\tt self.actual}
is 30.

{\tt RunModel} simulates coin tosses assuming that the coin is
actually fair.  It generates a sample of 250 tosses, uses {\tt Hist}
to count the number of heads and tails, and returns a pair of
integers.

Now all we have to do is instantiate {\tt CoinTest} and call
{\tt PValue}:

\begin{verbatim}
    ct = CoinTest((140, 110))
    pvalue = ct.PValue()
\end{verbatim}

The result is about 0.07, which means that if the coin is
fair, we expect to see a difference as big as 30 about 7\% of the
time.

How should we interpret this result?  By convention,
5\% is the threshold of statistical significance.  If the
p-value is less than 5\%, the effect is considered significant; otherwise
it is not.

But the choice of 5\% is arbitrary, and (as we will see later) the
p-value depends on the choice of the test statistics and
the model of the null hypothesis.  So p-values should not be considered
precise measurements.

Instead I recommend interpreting p-values according to their order of
magnitude: if the p-value is less than 1\%, the effect is unlikely to
be due to chance; if it is greater than 10\%, the effect can plausibly
be explained by chance.  P-values between 1\% and 10\% should be
considered borderline.  So in this example I would conclude that the
data do not provide strong evidence that the coin is biased or not.


\section{Testing a difference in means}
\label{testdiff}
\index{mean, difference in}

One of the most common effects to test is a difference in mean
between two groups.  In the NSFG data, we saw that the mean pregnancy
length for first babies is slightly longer, and the mean birth weight
is slightly smaller.  Now we will see if those effects are
statistically significant.
\index{National Survey of Family Growth}
\index{NSFG}
\index{pregnancy length}
\index{length!pregnancy}

For these examples, the null hypothesis is that the distributions
for the two groups are the same.  One way to model the null
hypothesis is by {\bf permutation}; that is, we can take values
for first babies and others and shuffle them, treating
the two groups as one big group:
\index{null hypothesis}

\begin{verbatim}
class DiffMeansPermute(thinkstats2.HypothesisTest):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        group1, group2 = data
        test_stat = abs(group1.mean() - group2.mean())
        return test_stat

    def MakeModel(self):
        group1, group2 = self.data
        self.n, self.m = len(group1), len(group2)
        self.pool = np.hstack((group1, group2))

    def RunModel(self):
        np.random.shuffle(self.pool)
        data = self.pool[:self.n], self.pool[self.n:]
        return data
\end{verbatim}

The parameter, {\tt data}, is a pair of sequences, one for each
group.  The test statistic is the absolute difference in the means.

{\tt MakeModel} records the sizes of the groups, {\tt n} and
{\tt m}, and combines the data from the groups into one NumPy
array, {\tt self.pool}.

{\tt RunModel} simulates the null hypothesis by shuffling the
pooled values and splitting them into two groups with sizes {\tt n}
and {\tt m}.  As always, the return value from {\tt RunModel} has
the same format as the observed data.

To test the difference in pregnancy length, we run:

\begin{verbatim}
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    data = firsts.prglngth.values, others.prglngth.values
    ht = DiffMeansPermute(data)
    pvalue = ht.PValue()
\end{verbatim}

{\tt MakeFrames} reads the NSFG data and returns DataFrames
representing all live births, first babies, and others.
We extract pregnancy lengths as NumPy arrays, pass them as
data to {\tt DiffMeansPermute}, and compute the p-value.  The
result is about 0.17, which means that we expect to see a difference
as big as the observed effect about 17\% of the time.  So
this effect is not statistically significant.

\begin{figure}
% hypothesis.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/hypothesis1.pdf}}
\caption{CDF of difference in mean pregnancy length under the null
hypothesis.}
\label{hypothesis1}
\end{figure}

{\tt HypothesisTest} provides {\tt PlotCdf}, which plots the
distribution of the test statistic and a gray line indicating
the observed effect size:

\begin{verbatim}
    ht.PlotCdf()
    thinkplot.Show(xlabel='test statistic',
                   ylabel='CDF')
\end{verbatim}

Figure~\ref{hypothesis1} shows the result.  The CDF intersects the
observed difference at 0.83, which is the complement of the p-value,
0.17.

If we run the same analysis with birth weight, the computed p-value
is 0; after 1000 attempts,
the simulation never yielded an effect
as big as the observed difference, 0.12 lbs.  So we would
report $p < 0.001$, and
conclude that the difference in birth weight is statistically
significant.


\section{Other test statistics}

Choosing the best test statistic depends on what question you are
trying to address.  For example, if the relevant question is whether
pregnancy lengths are different for first
babies, then it makes sense to test the absolute difference in means,
as we did in the previous section.

If we had some reason to think that first babies are likely
to be late, then we would not take the absolute value of the difference;
instead we would use this test statistic:

\begin{verbatim}
class DiffMeansOneSided(DiffMeansPermute):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        group1, group2 = data
        test_stat = group1.mean() - group2.mean()
        return test_stat
\end{verbatim}

{\tt DiffMeansOneSided} inherits {\tt MakeModel} and {\tt RunModel}
from {\tt DiffMeansPermute}; the only difference is that
{\tt TestStatistic} does not take the absolute value of the
difference.  This kind of test is called {\bf one-sided} because
it only counts one side of the distribution of differences.  The
previous test, using both sides, is {\bf two-sided}.

For this version of the test, the p-value is 0.09.  In general
the p-value for a one-sided test is about half the p-value for
a two-sided test, depending on the shape of the distribution.

The one-sided hypothesis, that first babies are born late, is more
specific than the two-sided hypothesis, so the p-value is smaller.
But even for the stronger hypothesis, the difference is
not statistically significant.

We can use the same framework to test for a difference in standard
deviation.  In Section~\ref{visualization}, we saw some evidence that
first babies are more likely to be early or late, and less likely to
be on time.  So we might hypothesize that the standard deviation is
higher.  Here's how we can test that:

\begin{verbatim}
class DiffStdPermute(DiffMeansPermute):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        group1, group2 = data
        test_stat = group1.std() - group2.std()
        return test_stat
\end{verbatim}

This is a one-sided test because the hypothesis is that the standard
deviation for first babies is higher, not just different.  The p-value
is 0.09, which is not statistically significant.


\section{Testing a correlation}
\label{corrtest}

This framework can also test correlations.  For example, in the NSFG
data set, the correlation between birth weight and mother's age is
about 0.07.  It seems like older mothers have heavier babies.  But
could this effect be due to chance?

For the test statistic, I'll use
Pearson's correlation, but Spearman's would work as well.
If we had reason to expect positive correlation, we would do a
one-sided test.  But since we have no such reason, I'll
do a two-sided test using the absolute value of correlation.

The null hypothesis is that there is no correlation between mother's
age and birth weight.  By shuffling the observed values, we can
simulate a world where the distributions of age and
birth weight are the same, but where the variables are unrelated:

\begin{verbatim}
class CorrelationPermute(thinkstats2.HypothesisTest):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        xs, ys = data
        test_stat = abs(thinkstats2.Corr(xs, ys))
        return test_stat

    def RunModel(self):
        xs, ys = self.data
        xs = np.random.permutation(xs)
        return xs, ys
\end{verbatim}

{\tt data} is a pair of sequences.  {\tt TestStatistic} computes the
absolute value of Pearson's correlation.  {\tt RunModel} shuffles the
{\tt xs} and returns simulated data.

Here's the code that reads the data and runs the test:

\begin{verbatim}
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    live = live.dropna(subset=['agepreg', 'totalwgt_lb'])
    data = live.agepreg.values, live.totalwgt_lb.values
    ht = CorrelationPermute(data)
    pvalue = ht.PValue()
\end{verbatim}

I use {\tt dropna} with the {\tt subset} argument to drop rows
that are missing either of the variables we need.

The actual correlation is 0.07.  The computed p-value is 0; after 1000
iterations the largest simulated correlation is 0.04.  So although the
observed correlation is small, it is statistically significant.

This example is a reminder that ``statistically significant'' does not
always mean that an effect is important, or significant in practice.
It only means that it is unlikely to have occurred by chance.


\section{Testing proportions}
\index{Chi-square test}

Suppose you run a casino and you suspect that a customer is
using a ``crooked die;'' that
is, one that has been modified to make one of the faces more
likely than the others.  You apprehend the alleged
cheater and confiscate the die, but now you have to prove that it
is crooked.  You roll the die 60 times and get the following results:
\index{casino}
\index{dice}
\index{crooked die}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Value     &  1  &  2  &  3  &  4  &  5  &  6  \\ 
\hline
Frequency &  8  &  9  &  19  &  5  &  8  &  11  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

On average you expect each value to appear 10 times.  In this
dataset, the value 3 appears more often than expected, and the value 4
appears less often.  But are these differences statistically
significant?

To test this hypothesis, we can compute the expected frequency for
each value, the difference between the expected and observed
frequencies, and the total absolute difference.  In this
example, we expect each side to come up 10 times out of 60; the
deviations from this expectation are -2, -1, 9, -5, -2, and 1; so the
total absolute difference is 20.  How often would we see a
difference as big as that by chance?

Here's a version of {\tt HypothesisTest} that answers that question:

\begin{verbatim}
class DiceTest(thinkstats2.HypothesisTest):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        observed = data
        n = sum(observed)
        expected = np.ones(6) * n / 6
        test_stat = sum(abs(observed - expected))
        return test_stat

    def RunModel(self):
        n = sum(self.data)
        values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        rolls = np.random.choice(values, n, replace=True)
        hist = thinkstats2.Hist(rolls)
        freqs = hist.Freqs(values)
        return freqs
\end{verbatim}

The data are represented as a list of frequencies: the observed
values are {\tt [8, 9, 19, 5, 8, 11]}; the expected frequencies
are all 10.  The test statistic is the sum of the absolute differences.

The null hypothesis is that the die is fair, so we simulate that by
drawing random samples from {\tt values}.  {\tt RunModel} uses {\tt
  Hist} to compute and return the list of frequencies.

The p-value for this data is 0.13, which means that if the die is
fair we expect to see the observed total deviation, or more, about
13\% of the time.  So the apparent effect is not statistically
significant.


\section{Chi-squared tests}

In the previous section we used total deviation as the test statistic.
But for testing proportions it is more common to use the chi-squared
statistic:
%
\[ \goodchi^2 = \sum_i \frac{(O_i - E_i)^2}{E_i} \]
%
%% TODO: Consider using upper case chi, which is more strictly correct,
%% but harder to distinguish from X.
% 
Where $O_i$ are the observed frequencies and $E_i$ are the expected
frequencies.  Here's the Python code:

\begin{verbatim}
class DiceChiTest(DiceTest):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        observed = data
        n = sum(observed)
        expected = np.ones(6) * n / 6
        test_stat = sum((observed - expected)**2 / expected)
        return test_stat
\end{verbatim}

Squaring the deviations (rather than taking absolute values) gives
more weight to large deviations.  Dividing through by {\tt expected}
standardizes the deviations, although in this case it has no effect
because the expected frequencies are all equal.

The p-value using the chi-squared statistic is 0.04,
substantially smaller than what we got using total deviation, 0.12.
If we take the 5\% threshold seriously, we would consider this effect
statistically significant.  But considering the two tests togther, I
would say that the results are borderline.  I would not rule out the
possibility that the die is crooked, but I would not convict the
accused cheater.

\section{First babies again}

Earlier in this chapter we looked at pregnancy lengths for first
babies and others, and concluded that the apparent differences in
mean and standard deviation are not statistically signficant.  But in
Section~\ref{visualization}, we saw several apparent differences
in the distribution of pregnancy length, especially in the range from
35 to 43 weeks.  To see whether those differences are statistically
significant, we can use a test based on a chi-squared statistic.

The code combines elements from previous examples, so it is
a bit more complex.  Here's the code that makes and runs the model:

\begin{verbatim}
class PregLengthTest(thinkstats2.HypothesisTest):

    def MakeModel(self):
        firsts, others = self.data
        self.n = len(firsts)
        self.pool = np.hstack((firsts, others))

        pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(self.pool)
        self.values = range(35, 44)
        self.expected_probs = np.array(pmf.Probs(self.values))

    def RunModel(self):
        """Run the model of the null hypothesis.

        returns: simulated data
        """
        np.random.shuffle(self.pool)
        data = self.pool[:self.n], self.pool[self.n:]
        return data
\end{verbatim}

The data are represented as two lists of pregnancy lengths.  The null
hypothesis is that both samples are drawn from the same distribution.
{\tt MakeModel} models that distribution by pooling the two
samples using {\tt hstack}.  Then {\tt RunModel} generates
simulated data by shuffling the pooled sample and splitting it
into two parts.

{\tt MakeModel} also defines {\tt values}, which is the
range of weeks we'll use, and \verb"expected_probs",
which is the probability of each value in the pooled distribution.

Here's the code that computes the test statistic:

\begin{verbatim}
#class PregLengthTest:

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        firsts, others = data
        stat = self.ChiSquared(firsts) + self.ChiSquared(others)
        return stat

    def ChiSquared(self, lengths):
        hist = thinkstats2.Hist(lengths)
        observed = np.array(hist.Freqs(self.values))
        expected = self.expected_probs * len(lengths)
        stat = sum((observed - expected)**2 / expected)
        return stat
\end{verbatim}

{\tt TestStatistic} computes the chi-squared statistic for
first babies and others, and adds them.

{\tt ChiSquared} takes a sequence of pregnancy lengths, computes
its histogram, and computes {\tt observed}, which is a list of
frequencies corresponding to {\tt self.values}.
To compute the list of expected frequencies, it multiplies the
pre-computed probabilities, \verb"expected_probs", by the sample
size.  It returns the chi-squared statistic, {\tt stat}.

For the NSFG data the total chi-squared statistic is 102, which
doesn't mean much by itself.  But after 1000 iteration, the largest
test statistic generated under the null hypothesis is 32.  We conclude
that the observed chi-squared statistic is unlikely under the null
hypothesis, so the apparent effect is statistically significant.

This example demonstrates a limitation of chi-squared tests: they
indicate that there is a difference between the two groups,
but they don't say anything specific about what the difference is.


\section{Errors}
\index{errors}

In classical hypothesis testing, an effect is considered statistically
significant if the p-value is below some threshold, commonly 5\%.
This procedure raises two question:

\begin{itemize}

\item If the effect is actually due to chance, what is the probability
that we will wrongly consider it significant?  This
probability is the {\bf false positive rate}.

\item If the effect is real, what is the chance that the hypothesis
test will fail?  This probability is the {\bf false negative rate}.

\end{itemize}

The false positive rate is relatively easy to compute: if the
threshold is 5\%, the false positive rate is 5\%.  Here's why:

\begin{itemize}

\item If there is no real effect, the null hypothesis is true, so we
  can compute the distribution of the test statistic by simulating the
  null hypothesis.  Call the distribution $T$ and its CDF $\CDF_T$.

\item Each time we run an experiment, we get a test statistic, $t$,
  which is drawn from $T$.  Then we compute a p-value, which is
  the probability that a random value from $T$ exceeds {\tt t},
  so that's $1 - CDF_T(t)$.

\item The p-value is less than 5\% if $CDF_T(t)$ is greater
  than 95\%; that is, if $t$ exceeds the 95th percentile.
  And how often does a value chosen from $T$ exceed
  the 95th percentile?  5\% of the time.

\end{itemize}

So if you perform one hypothesis test with a 5\% threshold, you expect
a false positive 1 time in 20.


\section{Power}
\label{power}

The false negative rate is harder to compute because it depends on
the actual effect size, and normally we don't know that.
One option is to compute a rate
conditioned on a hypothetical effect size.

For example, if we assume that the observed difference between groups
is accurate, we can use the observed samples as a model of the
population and run hypothesis tests with simulated data:

\begin{verbatim}
def FalseNegRate(data, num_runs=100):
    group1, group2 = data
    count = 0

    for i in range(num_runs):
        sample1 = thinkstats2.Resample(group1)
        sample2 = thinkstats2.Resample(group2)

        ht = DiffMeansPermute((sample1, sample2))
        pvalue = ht.PValue(iters=101)
        if pvalue > 0.05:
            count += 1

    return count / num_runs
\end{verbatim}

{\tt FalseNegRate} takes data in the form of two sequences, one for
each group.  Each time through the loop, it simulates an experiment by
drawing a random sample from each group and running a hypothesis test.
Then it checks the result and counts the number of false negatives.

{\tt Resample} takes a sequence and draws a sample with the same
length, with replacement:

\begin{verbatim}
def Resample(xs):
    return np.random.choice(xs, len(xs), replace=True)
\end{verbatim}

Here's the code that tests pregnancy lengths:

\begin{verbatim}
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    data = firsts.prglngth.values, others.prglngth.values
    neg_rate = FalseNegRate(data)
\end{verbatim}

The result is about 70\%, which means that if the actual difference in
mean pregnancy length is 0.78 weeks, we expect an experiment with this
sample size to yield a negative test 70\% of the time.

This result is often presented the other way around: if the actual
difference is 0.78 weeks, we should expect a positive test only 30\%
of the time.  This ``correct positive rate'' is called the {\bf power}
of the test, or sometimes ``sensitivity''.  It reflects the ability of
the test to detect an effect of a given size.

In this example, the test had only a 30\% chance of yielding a
positive result (again, assuming that the difference is 0.78 weeks).
As a rule of thumb, a power of 80\% is considered acceptable, so
we would say that this test was ``underpowered.''

In general a negative hypothesis test does not imply that there is no
difference between the groups; instead it suggests that if there is a
difference, it is too small to detect with this sample size.


\section{Replication}

The hypothesis testing process I demonstrated in this chapter is not,
strictly speaking, good practice.

First, I performed multiple tests.  If you run one hypothesis test,
the chance of a false positive is about 1 in 20, which might be
acceptable.  But if you run 20 tests, you should expect at least one
false positive, most of the time.

Second, I used the same dataset for exploration and testing.  If
you explore a large dataset, find a surprising effect, and then test
whether it is significant, you have a good chance of generating a
false positive.

To compensate for multiple tests, you can adjust the p-value
threshold\footnote{See
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm-Bonferroni_method}}.  Or you
can address both problems by partitioning the data, using one set for
exploration and the other for testing.

In some fields these practices are required or at least encouraged.
But it is more common to address these problems, implicitly, by
replicating published results.  Typically the first paper to report a
new result is considered exploratory.  Subsequent papers that
replicate the result with new data are considered confirmatory.

As it happens, we have an opportunity to replicate the results in this
chapter.  The first edition of this book is based on Cycle 6 of the
NSFG, which was released in 2002.  In October 2011, the CDC released
additional data based on interviews conducted from 2006--2010.  {\tt
  nsfg2.py} contains code to read and clean this data.  In the new
dataset:

\begin{itemize}

\item The difference in mean pregnancy length is
0.16 weeks and statistically significant with $p < 0.001$ (compared
to 0.078 weeks in the original dataset).

\item The difference in birth weight is 0.17 pounds with $p < 0.001$
(compared with 0.12 lbs in the original dataset).

\item The correlation between birthweight and mother's age is
0.08 with $p < 0.001$ (compared to 0.07).

\item The chi-squared test is statistically significant with
$p < 0.001$ (as it was in the original).

\end{itemize}

In summary, all of the effects that were statistically significant
in the original dataset were replicated in the new dataset, and the
difference in pregnancy length, which was not significant in the
original, is bigger in the new dataset and significant.


\section{Exercises}

A solution to these exercises is in \verb"chap09ex_soln.py".

\begin{exercise}
As sample size increases, the power of a hypothesis test increases,
which means it is more likely to be positive if the effect is real.
Conversely, as sample size decreases, the test is less likely to
be positive even if the effect is real.

To investigate this behavior, run the tests in this chapter with
different subsets of the NSFG data.  You can use {\tt thinkstats2.SampleRows}
to select a random subset of the rows in a DataFrame.
\index{National Survey of Family Growth}
\index{NSFG}

What happens to the p-values of these tests as sample size decreases?
What is the smallest sample size that yields a positive test?
\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}

In Section~\ref{testdiff}, we simulated the null hypothesis by
permutation; that is, we treated the observed values as if they
represented the entire population, and randomly assigned the
members of the population to the two groups.

An alternative is to use the sample to estimate the distribution for
the population, then draw a random sample from that distribution.
This process is called {\bf resampling}.  There are several ways to
implement the resampling, but one of the simplest is to draw a sample,
with replacement, from the observed values, as in Section~\ref{power}.

Write a class named {\tt DiffMeansResample} that inherits from
{\tt DiffMeansPermute} and overrides {\tt RunModel} to implement
resampling, rather than permutation.

Use this model to test the differences in pregnancy length and
birth weight.  How much does the model affect the results?

\end{exercise}

\chapter{Linear least squares}
\label{linear}

The code for this chapter is in {\tt linear.py}.  For information
about downloading and working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.

\section{Least squares fit}

Correlation coefficients measure the strength and sign of a
relationship, but not the slope.  There are several ways to estimate
the slope; the most common is a {\bf linear least squares fit}.  A
``linear fit'' is a line intended to model the relationship between
variables.  A ``least squares'' fit is one that minimizes the mean
squared error (MSE) between the line and the data.
\index{least squares fit}
\index{linear least squares}
\index{coefficient!correlation}

Suppose we have a sequence of points, {\tt ys}, that we want to
express as a function of another sequence {\tt xs}.  If there is a
linear relationship between {\tt xs} and {\tt ys} with intercept {\tt
  inter} and slope {\tt slope}, we expect each {\tt y[i]} to be
{\tt inter + slope * x[i]}.  \index{residual}

But unless the correlation is perfect, this prediction is only
approximate.  The vertical deviation from the line, or {\bf residual},
is

\begin{verbatim}
res = ys - (inter + slope * xs)
\end{verbatim}

The residuals might be due to random factors like measurement error,
or non-random factors that are unknown.  For example, if we are
trying to predict weight as a function of height, unknown factors
might include diet, exercise, and body type.
\index{slope}
\index{intercept}

If we get the parameters {\tt inter} and {\tt slope} wrong, the residuals
get bigger, so it makes intuitive sense that the parameters we want
are the ones that minimize the residuals.

We might try to minimize the absolute value of the
residuals, or their squares, or their cubes; but the most common
choice is to minimize the sum of squared residuals,
{\tt sum(res**2))}.

Why?  There are three good reasons and one less important one:

\begin{itemize}

\item Squaring has the feature of treating positive and
negative residuals the same, which is usually what we want.

\item Squaring gives more weight to large residuals, but not
so much weight that the largest residual always dominates.

\item If the residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with
  mean 0 and constant (but unknown) variance, then the least squares
  fit is also the maximum likelihood estimator of {\tt inter} and {\tt
    slope}.  See
  \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression}.  \index{MLE}
  \index{maximum likelihood estimator}

\item The values of {\tt inter} and {\tt slope} that minimize
  the squared residuals can be computed efficiently.

\end{itemize}

The last reason made sense when computational efficiency was more
important than choosing the method most appropriate to the problem
at hand.  That's no longer the case, so it is worth considering
whether squared residuals are the right thing to minimize.
\index{computation}

For example, if you are using {\tt xs} to predict values of {\tt ys},
guessing too high might be better (or worse) than guessing too low.
In that case you might want to compute some cost function for each
residual, and minimize total cost, {\tt sum(cost(res))}.
However, computing a least squares fit is quick, easy and often good
enough.  
\index{cost function}


\section{Implementation}

{\tt thinkstats2} provides simple functions that demonstrate
linear least squares:

\begin{verbatim}
def LeastSquares(xs, ys):
    meanx, varx = MeanVar(xs)
    meany = Mean(ys)

    slope = Cov(xs, ys, meanx, meany) / varx
    inter = meany - slope * meanx

    return inter, slope
\end{verbatim}

To see how this is derived, see
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_methods_for_linear_least_squares}.

{\tt LeastSquares} takes sequences
{\tt xs} and {\tt ys} and returns the estimated parameters {\tt inter}
and {\tt slope}.

{\tt thinkstats2} also provides {\tt FitLine}, which takes the
estimated parameters and returns the fitted line for a sequence
of {\tt xs}.

\begin{verbatim}
def FitLine(xs, inter, slope):
    fit_xs = np.sort(xs)
    fit_ys = inter + slope * fit_xs
    return fit_xs, fit_ys
\end{verbatim}

We can use these functions to compute the least squares fit for
birth weight as a function of mother's age.

\begin{verbatim}
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    live = live.dropna(subset=['agepreg', 'totalwgt_lb'])
    ages = live.agepreg
    weights = live.totalwgt_lb

    inter, slope = thinkstats2.LeastSquares(ages, weights)
    fit_xs, fit_ys = thinkstats2.FitLine(ages, inter, slope)
\end{verbatim}

The estimated intercept and slope are 6.8 lbs and 0.017 lbs per year.
These value are hard to interpret in this form: the intercept is
the expected weight of a baby whose mother is 0 years old, which
doesn't make sense in context, and the slope is too small to
grasp easily.

Instead of presenting the intercept at $x=0$, it
is often helpful to present the intercept at the mean of $x$.  In
this case the mean age is about 25 years and the expected weight
for a 25 year old mother is 7.3 pounds.  The slope is 0.27 ounces
per year, or 0.17 pounds per decade.

\begin{figure}
% linear.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/linear1.pdf}}
\caption{Scatter plot of birth weight and mother's age with
a linear fit.}
\label{linear1}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{linear1} shows a scatter plot of birth weight and age
along with the fitted line.  It's a good idea to look at a figure like
this to assess whether the relationship is linear and whether the
fitted line seems like a good model of the relationship.


\section{Residuals}

Another useful test is to plot the residuals.
{\tt thinkstats2} provides a function that computes residuals:

\begin{verbatim}
def Residuals(xs, ys, inter, slope):
    xs = np.asarray(xs)
    ys = np.asarray(ys)
    res = ys - (inter + slope * xs)
    return res
\end{verbatim}

{\tt Residuals} takes sequences {\tt xs} and {\tt ys} and
estimated parameters {\tt inter} and {\tt slope}.  It returns
the differences between the actual values and the fitted line.

To visualize the residuals, I group respondents by age and compute
percentiles in each group, as we saw in Section~\ref{characterizing}.
Figure~\ref{linear2} shows the 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of
the residuals for each age group.  The median is near zero, as
expected, and the interquartile range is about 2 pounds.  So if we
know the mother's age, we can guess the baby's weight within a pound,
about 50\% of the time.

Ideally these lines should be flat, indicating that the residuals are
random, and parallel, indicating that the variance of the residuals is
the same for all age groups.  In fact, the lines are close to
parallel, so that's good; but they have some curvature, indicating
that the relationship is non-linear.  Nevertheless, the linear fit
is a simple model that is probably good enough for some purposes.

\caption{Residuals of the linear fit.}
\label{linear2}
\end{figure}


\section{Estimation}
\label{regest}

The parameters {\tt slope} and {\tt inter} are estimates based on a
sample; like other estimates, they are vulnerable to sampling bias,
measurement error, and sampling error.  As discussed in
Chapter~\ref{estimation}, sampling bias is caused by non-representative
sampling, measurement error is caused by errors in collecting
and recording data, and sampling error is the result of measuring a
sample rather than the entire population.

To assess sampling error, we ask, ``If we run this experiment again,
how much variability do we expect in the estimates?''  We can
answer this question by running simulated experiments and computing
sampling distributions of the estimates.

I simulate the experiments by resampling the data; that is, I treat
the observed pregnancies as if they were the entire population
and draw samples, with replacement, from the observed sample.

\begin{verbatim}
def SamplingDistributions(live, iters=101):
    t = []
    for _ in range(iters):
        sample = thinkstats2.SampleRows(live, len(live), replace=True)
        ages = sample.agepreg
        weights = sample.totalwgt_lb
        estimates = thinkstats2.LeastSquares(ages, weights)
        t.append(estimates)

    inters, slopes = zip(*t)
    return inters, slopes
\end{verbatim}

{\tt SamplingDistributions} takes a DataFrame with one row
per live birth, and {\tt iters}, the number of experiments to simulate.
It uses {\tt SampleRows} to resample the observed pregnancies,
then uses the simulated sample to estimate the parameters.
It returns sequences
of estimated intercepts and estimated slopes.

I summarize the sampling distributions by printing the standard
error and confidence interval:

\begin{verbatim}
def Summarize(values, actual):
    std = thinkstats2.Std(values, mu=actual)
    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(values)
    ci = cdf.Percentile(5), cdf.Percentile(95)
    print('SE, CI', std, ci)
\end{verbatim}

For the intercept, the estimated value is 6.83, with standard error
0.07 and 90\% confidence interval (6.71, 6.94).  The estimated slope, in
more compact form, is 0.0174, SE 0.0028, CI (0.0126, 0.0220).
There is almost a factor of two between the low and high ends of
this CI, so it should be considered a rough estimate.

%inter 6.83039697331 6.83174035366
%SE, CI 0.0699814482068 (6.7146843084406846, 6.9447797068631871)
%slope 0.0174538514718 0.0173840926936
%SE, CI 0.00276116142884 (0.012635074392201724, 0.021975282350381781)

To visualize the sampling error of the estimate, we could plot
all of the fitted lines, or for a less cluttered representation,
plot a 90\% confidence interval for each age.  Here's the code:

\begin{verbatim}
def PlotConfidenceIntervals(xs, inters, slopes, **options):
    size = len(slopes), len(xs)
    array = np.zeros(size)

    for i, (inter, slope) in enumerate(zip(inters, slopes)):
        fxs, fys = thinkstats2.FitLine(xs, inter, slope)
        array[i,] = fys

    xs = np.sort(xs)
    array = np.sort(array, axis=0)
    
    low = array[5,]
    high = array[95,]
    thinkplot.FillBetween(xs, low, high, **options)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt xs} is the sequence of mother's age.  {\tt inters} and {\tt slopes}
are the estimates parameters generated by {\tt SamplingDistributions}.

{\tt PlotConfidenceIntervals} generates a fitted line for each pairs
of {\tt inter} and {\tt slope} and stores the results in an array with
one row per simulated experiment.  Then it sorts each column in the
array, and selects the row with indices 5 and 95, which contain the
5th and 95th percentiles (this is a simplified version of the code for
the case where there are 101 rows).

{\tt FillBetween} draws a polygon that fills the space between two
lines.  Figure~\ref{linear3} shows the 50\% and 90\% confidence
intervals.  The vertical width of the region represents the effect of
sampling error; the effect is smaller for values near the mean and
larger for the extremes.

\begin{figure}
% linear.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/linear3.pdf}}
\caption{50\% and 90\% confidence intervals showing variability in the
  fitted line due to sampling error of {\tt inter} and {\tt slope}.}
\label{linear3}
\end{figure}


\section{Goodness of fit}
\label{goodness}
\index{goodness of fit}
\index{fit, goodness}

There are several ways to measure the quality of a linear model, or
{\bf goodness of fit}.  One of the simplest is the standard deviation
of the residuals.

If you use a linear model to make predictions, {\tt Std(res)}
is the root mean squared error (RMSE) of your predictions.  For
example, if you use mother's age to guess birth weight, the RMSE of
your guess would be 1.40 lbs.

If you guess birth weight without knowing the mother's age, the RMSE
of your guess is {\tt Std(ys)}, which is 1.41 lbs.  So in this
example, knowing a mother's age does not improve the predictions
substantially.

Another way to measure goodness of fit is  the {\bf
  coefficient of determination}, usually denoted $R^2$ and 
called ``R-squared'':

\begin{verbatim}
def CoefDetermination(ys, res):
    return 1 - Var(res) / Var(ys)
\end{verbatim}

{\tt Var(res)} is the MSE of your guesses using the model,
{\tt Var(ys)} is the MSE without it.   So their ratio is the fraction
of MSE that remains if you use the model, and $R^2$ is the fraction
of MSE the model eliminates.

For birth weight and mother's age, $R^2$ is 0.0047, which means
that mother's age predicts less than half of 1\% of variance in
birth weight.

There is a simple relationship between the coefficient of
determination and Pearson's correlation coefficient: $R^2 = \rho^2$.
For example, if $\rho$ is 0.8 or -0.8, $R^2 = 0.64$.

Although $\rho$ and $R^2$ are often used to quantify the strength of a
relationship, they are not easy to interpret in terms of predictive
power.  In my opinion, {\tt Std(res)} is the best representation
of the quality of prediction, especially if it is presented
in relation to {\tt Std(ys)}.

For example, when people talk about the validity of the SAT
(a standardized test used for college admission in the U.S.) they
often talk about correlations between SAT scores and other measures of
intelligence.

According to one study, there is a Pearson correlation of
$\rho=0.72$ between total SAT scores and IQ scores, which sounds like
a strong correlation.  But $R^2 = \rho^2 = 0.52$, so SAT scores
account for only 52\% of variance in IQ.

IQ scores are normalized so {\tt Std(ys) = 15}, so

\begin{verbatim}
>>> var_ys = 15**2
>>> rho = 0.72
>>> r2 = rho**2
>>> var_res = (1 - r2) * var_ys
>>> std_res = math.sqrt(var_res)
10.4096
\end{verbatim}

So using SAT score to predict IQ reduces RMSE from 15 points to 10.4
points.  A correlation of 0.72 yields a reduction in RMSE of only
31\%.

If you see a correlation that looks impressive, remember that $R^2$ is
a better indicator of reduction in MSE, and reduction in RMSE is a
better indicator of predictive power.


\section{Testing a linear model}

The effect of mother's age on birth weight is small, and has little
predictive power.  So is it possible that the apparent relationship
is due to chance?  There are several ways we might test the
results of a linear fit.

One option is to test whether the apparent reduction in MSE is due to
chance.  In that case, the test statistic is $R^2$ and the null
hypothesis is that there is no relationship between the variables.  We
can simulate the null hypothesis by permutation, as in
Section~\ref{corrtest}, when we tested the correlation between
mother's age and birthweight.  In fact, because $R^2 = \rho^2$, a
one-sided test of $R^2$ is equivalent to a two-sided test of $\rho$.
We've already done that test, and found $p < 0.001$, so we conclude
that the apparent relationship between mother's age and birth weight
is statistically significant.
  
Another approach is to test whether the apparent slope is due to chance.
The null hypothesis is that the slope is actually zero; in that case
we can model the birth weights as random variations around their mean.
Here's a HypothesisTest for this model:

\begin{verbatim}
class SlopeTest(thinkstats2.HypothesisTest):

    def TestStatistic(self, data):
        ages, weights = data
        _, slope = thinkstats2.LeastSquares(ages, weights)
        return slope

    def MakeModel(self):
        _, weights = self.data
        self.ybar = weights.mean()
        self.res = weights - self.ybar

    def RunModel(self):
        ages, _ = self.data
        weights = self.ybar + np.random.permutation(self.res)
        return ages, weights
\end{verbatim}

The data are represented as sequences of ages and weights.  The
test statistic is the slope estimated by {\tt LeastSquares}.
The model of the null hypothesis is represented by the mean weight
of all babies and the deviations from the mean.  To
generate simulated data, we permute the deviations and add them to
the mean.

Here's the code that runs the hypothesis test:

\begin{verbatim}
    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    live = live.dropna(subset=['agepreg', 'totalwgt_lb'])
    ht = SlopeTest((live.agepreg, live.totalwgt_lb))
    pvalue = ht.PValue()
\end{verbatim}

The p-value is less than $0.001$, so although the estimated
slope is small, it is unlikely to be due to chance.

Estimating the p-value by simulating the null hypothesis is strictly
correct, but there is a simpler alternative.  Remember that we already
computed the sampling distribution of the slope, in
Section~\ref{regest}.  To do that, we assumed that the observed slope
was correct and simulated experiments by resampling.

Figure~\ref{linear4} shows the sampling distribution of the
slope, from Section~\ref{regest}, and the distribution of slopes
generated under the null hypothesis.  The sampling distribution
is centered about the estimated slope, 0.017 lbs/year, and the slopes
under the null hypothesis are centered around 0; but other than
that, the distributions are identical.  The distributions are
also symmetric, for reasons we will see in Section~\ref{CLT}.

\begin{figure}
% linear.py
\centerline{\includegraphics[height=2.5in]{figs/linear4.pdf}}
\caption{The sampling distribution of the estimated
slope and the distribution of slopes
generated under the null hypothesis.  The vertical lines are at 0
and the observed slope, 0.017 lbs/year.}
\label{linear4}
\end{figure}

So we could estimate the p-value two ways:

\begin{itemize}

\item Compute the probability that the slope under the null
hypothesis exceeds the observed slope.

\item Compute the probability that the slope in the sampling
distribution falls below 0.  If the estimated slope were negative,
we would compute the probability that the slope in the sampling
distribution exceeds 0.

\end{itemize}

The second option is easier because we normally want to compute the
sampling distributions of the parameters anyway.  And it is a good
approximation unless the sample size is small {\em and} the
distribution of residuals is skewed.  Even then, it is usually good
enough, because p-values don't have to be precise.

Here's the code that estimates the p-value of the slope using the
sampling distribution:

\begin{verbatim}
    inters, slopes = SamplingDistributions(live, iters=1001)
    slope_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(slopes)
    pvalue = slope_cdf[0]
\end{verbatim}

Again, we find $p < 0.001$.  


\section{Weighted resampling}

So far we have treated the NSFG data as if it were a representative
sample, but as I mentioned in Section~\ref{nsfg}, it is not.  The
survey deliberately oversamples several groups in order to
improve the chance of getting statistically significant results; that
is, in order to improve the power of tests involving these groups.

This survey design is useful for many purposes, but it means that we
cannot use the sample to estimate values for the general
population without accounting for the sampling process.

For each respondent, the NSFG data includes a variable called {\tt
  finalwgt}, which is the number of people in the general population
the respondent represents.  This value is called a {\bf sampling
  weight}, or just ``weight.''

As an example, if you survey 100,000 people in a country of 300
million, each respondent represents 3,000 people.  If you oversample
one group by a factor of 2, each person in the oversampled
group would have a lower weight, about 1500.

To correct for oversampling, we can use resampling; that is, we
can draw samples from the survey using probabilities proportional
to sampling weights.  Then, for any quantity we want to estimate, we can
generate sampling distributions, standard errors, and confidence
intervals.  As an example, I will estimate mean birth weight with
and without sample weights.

We've already seen {\tt SampleRows}, which chooses random rows
from a DataFrame.  {\tt thinkstats2} also provide {\tt ResampleRows},
which handles the case when the new sample is the same size as the original:

\begin{verbatim}
def ResampleRows(df):
    return SampleRows(df, len(df), replace=True)
\end{verbatim}

Now we need to do the same thing using sample weights.
{\tt ResampleRowsWeighted} takes a DataFrame, resamples rows according
to the weights in {\tt finalwgt}, and returns a DataFrame containing
the resampled rows:

\begin{verbatim}
def ResampleRowsWeighted(df):
    weights = df.finalwgt
    pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(weights.iteritems())
    cdf = pmf.MakeCdf()
    indices = cdf.Sample(len(weights))
    sample = df.loc[indices]
    return sample
\end{verbatim}

{\tt pmf} maps from each row index to its normalized weight.  Converting
to a Cdf makes the sampling process faster.  {\tt indices} is a sequence
of row indices; {\tt sample} is a DataFrame that contains the selected
rows.  Since we sample with replacement, the same row might appear
more than once.

Now we can compare the effect of resampling with and without
weights.  Without weights, we generate the sampling distribution
like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    estimates = [thinkstats2.ResampleRows(live).totalwgt_lb.mean()
                 for _ in range(iters)]
\end{verbatim}

With weights, it looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    estimates = [ResampleRowsWeighted(live).totalwgt_lb.mean()
                 for _ in range(iters)]
\end{verbatim}

The following table summarizes the results:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|}
\hline
                    &  mean birth   & standard  &  90\% CI  \\ 
                    &  weight (lbs) & error     &           \\ 
\hline
Unweighted          &  7.27  &  0.014  &  (7.24, 7.29)  \\ 
Weighted            &  7.35  &  0.014  &  (7.32, 7.37)  \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

%mean 7.26580789518
%stderr 0.0141683527792
%ci (7.2428565501217079, 7.2890814917127074)
%mean 7.34778034718
%stderr 0.0142738972319
%ci (7.3232804012858885, 7.3704916897506925)

In this example, the effect of weighting is small but non-negligible.
The difference in estimated means, with and without weighting, is
about 0.08 pounds, or 1.3 ounces.  This difference is substantially
larger than the standard error of the estimate, 0.014 pounds, which
implies that the difference is not due to chance.


\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}

Using the data from the BRFSS, compute the linear least squares
fit for log(weight) versus height.
How would you best present the estimated parameters for a model
like this where one of the variables is log-transformed?
If you were trying to guess
someone's weight, how much would it help to know their height?
\index{Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System}
\index{BRFSS}

Like the NSFG, the BRFSS oversamples some groups and provides
a sampling weight for each respondent.  In the BRFSS data, the variable
name for these weights is {\tt totalwt}.
Use resampling, with and without weights, to estimate the mean height
of respondents in the BRFSS, the standard error of the mean, and a
90\% confidence interval.  How much does correct weighting affect the
estimates?

A solution to this exercise is in \verb"chap10ex_soln.ipynb"

\chapter{Regression}
\label{regression}

The linear least squares fit in the previous chapter is an example of
{\bf regression}, which is the more general problem of fitting any
kind of model to any kind of data.  This use of the term ``regression''
is a historical accident; it is only indirectly related to the
original meaning of the word.

The goal of regression analysis is to describe the relationship
between one set of variables, called the {\bf dependent variables},
and another set of variables, called independent or {\bf
  explanatory variables}.

In the previous chapter we used mother's age as an explanatory
variable to predict birth weight as a dependent variable.  When there
is only one dependent and one explanatory variable, that's called {\bf
  simple regression}.  In this chapter, we move on to {\bf multiple
  regression}, with more than one explanatory variable.  If there is
more than one dependent variable, that's called multivariate
regression.

If the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variable
is linear, that's called {\bf linear regression}.  For example,
if the dependent variable is $y$ and the explanatory variables
are $x_1$ and $x_2$, we would write the following linear
regression model:
%
\[ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \eps \]
%
where $\beta_0$ is the intercept, $\beta_1$ is the parameter
associated with $x_1$, $\beta_2$ is the parameter associated with
$x_2$, and $\eps$ is the residual due to random variation or other
unknown factors.

Given a sequence of values for $y$ and sequences for $x_1$ and $x_2$,
we can find the parameters, $\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$, that
minimize the sum of $\eps^2$.  This process is called
{\bf ordinary least squares}.  The implementation is similar to {\tt
  thinkstats2.LeastSquare}, but generalized to deal with more than one
explanatory variable.  You can find the details at
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares}

The code for this chapter is in {\tt regression.py}.  For information
about downloading and working with this code, see Section~\ref{code}.

\section{StatsModels}

In the previous chapter I presented {\tt thinkstats2.LeastSquares}, an
implementation of simple linear regression intended to be easy to
read.  For multiple regression we'll switch to StatsModels, a Python
package that provides several forms of regression and other
analyses.  If you are using Anaconda, you already have StatsModels;
otherwise you might have to install it.

As an example, I'll run the model from the previous chapter with
StatsModels:

\begin{verbatim}
    import statsmodels.formula.api as smf

    live, firsts, others = first.MakeFrames()
    formula = 'totalwgt_lb ~ agepreg'
    model = smf.ols(formula, data=live)
    results = model.fit()
\end{verbatim}

{\tt statsmodels} provides two interfaces (APIs); the ``formula''
API uses strings to identify the dependent and explanatory variables.
It uses a syntax called {\tt patsy}; in this example, the {\tt ~}
operator separates the dependent variable on the left from the
explatory variables on the right.

{\tt smf.ols} takes the formula string and the DataFrame, {\tt live},
and returns an object that represents the model.  The name {\tt ols}
stands for ``ordinary least squares.''

The {\tt fit} method fits the model to the data and returns an
object that contains the results.  

The results are also available as attributes.  {\tt params}
is a Series that maps from variable names to their parameters, so we can
get the intercept and slope like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    inter = results.params['Intercept']
    slope = results.params['agepreg']
\end{verbatim}

The estimated parameters are 6.83 and 0.0175, the same as
from {\tt LeastSquares}.

{\tt pvalues} is a Series that maps from variable name to the associated
p-value, so we can check whether the estimated slope is statistically
significant:

\begin{verbatim}
    slope_pvalue = results.pvalues['agepreg']
\end{verbatim}

The p-value associated with {\tt agepreg} is {\tt 5.7e-11}, which
is less than $0.001$, as expected.

{\tt results.rsquared} contains $R^2$, which is $0.0047$.  {\tt
  results} also provides \verb"f_pvalue", which is the p-value
associated with the model as a whole, similar to testing whether $R^2$
is statitically significant.

And {\tt results} provides {\tt resid}, a sequence of residuals, and
{\tt fittedvalues}, a sequence of fitted values corresponding to
{\tt agepreg}.

The results object provides {\tt summary()}, which
represents the results in a readable format.  

\begin{verbatim}
    print(results.summary())
\end{verbatim}

But it prints a lot of information that is not relevant (yet), so
I use a simpler function called {\tt SummarizeResults}.  Here are
the results of this model:

\begin{verbatim}
   Intercept	6.83	(0)
     agepreg	0.0175	(5.72e-11)
R^2 0.004738
Std(ys) 1.408
Std(res) 1.405
\end{verbatim}

{\tt Std(ys)} is the standard deviation of the dependent variable,
which is the RMSE if you have to guess birth weights without the benefit of
any explanatory variables.  {\tt Std(res)} is the standard deviation
of the residuals, which is the RMSE if your guesses are informed
by the mother's age.  As we have already seen, knowing the mother's
age provides no substantial improvement to the predictions.


\section{Multiple regression}
\label{multiple}

In Section~\ref{birth_weights} we saw that first babies tend to be
lighter than others, and this effect is statistically significant.
But it is a strange result because there is no obvious mechanism that
would cause first babies to be lighter.  So we might wonder whether
this relationship is {\bf spurious}.

In fact, there is a possible explanation for this effect.  We have
seen that birth weight depends on mother's age, and we might expect
that mother's of first babies are younger than others.

With a few calculations we can check whether this explanation
is plausible.  Then we can use multiple regression to investigate
more carefully.  First, let's see how big the difference in weight
is:

\begin{verbatim}
diff_weight = firsts.totalwgt_lb.mean() - others.totalwgt_lb.mean()
\end{verbatim}

First babies are 0.125 lbs lighter, or 2 ounces.  And the difference
in ages:

\begin{verbatim}
diff_age = firsts.agepreg.mean() - others.agepreg.mean()
\end{verbatim}

The mothers of first babies are 3.59 years younger.  Running the
linear model again, we get the change in birth weight as a function
of age:

\begin{verbatim}
results = smf.ols('totalwgt_lb ~ agepreg', data=live).fit()
slope = results.params['agepreg']
\end{verbatim}

The slope is 0.175 pounds per year.  If we multiply the slope by
the difference in ages, we get the expected difference in birth
weight for first babies and others, due to mother's age:

\begin{verbatim}
slope * diff_age
\end{verbatim}

The result is 0.063, just about half of the observed difference.
So we conclude, tentatively, that the observed difference in birth
weight can be partly explained by the difference in mother's age. 

Using multiple regression, we can explore these relationships
more systematically.

\begin{verbatim}
    live['isfirst'] = live.birthord == 1
    formula = 'totalwgt_lb ~ isfirst'
    results = smf.ols(formula, data=live).fit()
\end{verbatim}

The first line creates a new column named {\tt isfirst} that is
True for first babies and false otherwise.  Then we fit a model
using {\tt isfirst} as an explanatory variable.

Here are the results:

\begin{verbatim}
   Intercept	  7.33	(0)
isfirst[T.True]  -0.125	(2.55e-05)
R^2 0.00196
\end{verbatim}

Because {\tt isfirst} is a boolean, {\tt ols} treats it as a
{\bf categorical variable}, which means that the values fall
into categories, like True and False, and should not be treated
as numbers.  The estimated parameter is the effect on birth
weight when {\tt isfirst} is true, so the result,
-0.125 lbs, is the difference in
birth weight between first babies and others.  

This parameter, and the intercept, are statistically significant,
which means that they were unlikely to occur by chance, but the
the $R^2$ value for this model is small, which means that
{\tt isfirst} doesn't account for a substantial part of the
variation in birth weight.

The results are simular with {\tt agepreg}:

\begin{verbatim}
Intercept	6.83	(0)
agepreg	        0.0175	(5.72e-11)
R^2 0.004738
\end{verbatim}

Again, the parameters are statistically significant, but
$R^2$ is low.

These models confirm results we have already seen.  But now we
can fit a single model that includes both variables.  With the
formula \verb"totalwgt_lb ~ isfirst + agepreg", we get:

\begin{verbatim}
Intercept	 6.91	(0)
isfirst[T.True]	-0.0698	(0.0253)
agepreg	         0.0154	(3.93e-08)
R^2 0.005289
\end{verbatim}

In the combined model, the parameter for {\tt isfirst} is smaller
by about half, which means that part of the apparent effect of
{\tt isfirst} is actually accounted for by {\tt agepreg}.  And
the p-value for {\tt isfirst} is about 2.5\%, which is on the
border of statistical significance.

$R^2$ for this model is a little higher, which indicates that the
two variables together account for more variation in birth weight
than either alone (but not by much).


\section{Non-linear relationships}

Remembering that the contribution of {\tt agepreg} might be non-linear,
we might consider adding a variable to capture more of this
relationship.  One option is to create a column, {\tt agepreg2}
that contains the squares of the ages:

\begin{verbatim}
    live['agepreg2'] = live.agepreg**2
    formula = 'totalwgt_lb ~ isfirst + agepreg + agepreg2'
\end{verbatim}

Now by estimating parameters for {\tt agepreg} and {\tt agepreg2},
we are effectively fitting a parabola:

\begin{verbatim}
   Intercept	 5.69	 (1.38e-86)
isfirst[T.True]	-0.0504	 (0.109)
     agepreg	 0.112	 (3.23e-07)
    agepreg2	-0.00185 (8.8e-06)
R^2 0.007462
\end{verbatim}

The parameter of {\tt agepreg2} is negative, so the parabola is
curves downward, which is consistent with the shape of the lines
in Figure~\ref{linear2}.

The quadratic model of {\tt agepreg} accounts for more of the
variability in birth weight; the parameter for {\tt isfirst}
is smaller in this model, and no longer statistically signficant.

Using computed variables like {\tt agepreg2} is a common way to
fit polynomials and other functions to data.  
This process is still considered linear
regression, because the dependent variable is a linear function of
the explanatory variables, regardless of whether some variables
are non-linear functions of others.

The following table summarizes the results of these regressions:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}
\hline & isfirst & agepreg & agepreg2 & $R^2$ \\ \hline
Model 1 & -0.125 * & -- & -- & 0.002 \\
Model 2 & -- & 0.0175 * & -- & 0.0047 \\
Model 3 & -0.0698 (0.025) & 0.0154 * & -- & 0.0053 \\
Model 4 & -0.0504 (0.11) & 0.112 * & -0.00185 * & 0.0075 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We conclude that the apparent difference in birth weight
is explained, at least in part, by the difference in mother's age.
When we include mother's age in the model, the effect of
{\tt isfirst} gets smaller, and the remaining effect might be
due to chance.

In this example, mother's age acts as a {\bf control variable};
including {\tt agepreg} in the model ``controls for'' the
difference in age between first-time mothers and others, making
it possible to isolate the effect (if any) of {\tt isfirst}. 


\section{Data mining}
\label{mining}

So far we have used regression models for explanation; for example,
in the previous section we discovered that an apparent difference
in birth weight is actually due to a difference in mother's age.
But the $R^2$ values of those models is very low, which means that
they have little predictive power.  In this section we'll try to
do better.

Suppose one of your co-workers is expecting a baby and
there is an office pool to guess the baby's birth weight (if you are
not familiar with betting pools, see
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_pool}).

Now suppose that you {\em really} want to win the pool.  What could
you do to improve your chances?  Well, 
the NSFG dataset includes 244 variables about each pregnancy and another
3087 variables about each respondent.  Maybe some of those variables
have predictive power.  To find out which ones are most useful,
why not try them all?

Testing the variables in the pregnancy table is easy, but in order to
use the variables in the respondent table, we have to match up each
pregnancy with a respondent.  In theory we could iterate through the
rows of the pregnancy table, use the {\tt caseid} to find the
corresponding respondent, and copy the values from the
correspondent table into the pregnancy table.  But that would be slow.

A better option is to recognize this process as a {\bf join} operation
as defined in SQL and other relational database languages (see
\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_(SQL)}).  Join is implemented
as a DataFrame method, so we can perform the operation like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    live = live[live.prglngth>30]
    resp = chap01ex_soln.ReadFemResp()
    resp.index = resp.caseid
    join = live.join(resp, on='caseid', rsuffix='_r')
\end{verbatim}

The first line selects records for pregnancies longer than 30 weeks,
assuming that the office pool is formed several weeks before the
due date.

The next line reads the respondent file.  The result is a DataFrame
with integer indices; in order to look up respondents efficiently,
I replace {\tt resp.index} with {\tt resp.caseid}. 

The {\tt join} method is invoked on {\tt live}, which is considered
the ``left'' table, and passed {\tt resp}, which is the ``right'' table.
The keyword argument {\tt on} indicates the variable used to match up
rows from the two tables.

In this example some column names appear in both tables,
so we have to provide {\tt rsuffix}, which is a string that will be
appended to the names of overlapping columns from the right table.
For example, both tables have a column named {\tt race} that encodes
the race of the respondent.  The result of the join contains two
columns named {\tt race} and \verb"race_r".

The pandas implementation is fast.  Joining the NSFG tables takes
less than a second on an ordinary desktop computer.
Now we can start testing variables.

\begin{verbatim}
    t = []
    for name in join.columns:
        try:
            if join[name].var() < 1e-7:
                continue

            formula = 'totalwgt_lb ~ agepreg + ' + name
            model = smf.ols(formula, data=join)
            if model.nobs < len(join)/2:
                continue

            results = model.fit()
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            continue

        t.append((results.rsquared, name))
\end{verbatim}

For each variable we construct a model, compute $R^2$, and append
the results to a list.  The models all include {\tt agepreg}, since
we already know that it has some predictive power.

I check that each explanatory variable has some variability; otherwise
the results of the regression are unreliable.  I also check the number
of observations for each model.  Variables that contains a large number
of NA values are not good candidates for prediction.

For most of these variables, we haven't done any cleaning.  Some of them
are encoded in ways that don't work very well for linear regression.
As a result, we might overlook some variables that would be useful if
they were cleaned properly.  But maybe we will find some good candidates.


\section{Predictive modeling}

The next step is to sort the results and select the variables that
yield the highest values of $R^2$.

\begin{verbatim}
    t.sort(reverse=True)
    for mse, name in t[:30]:
        print(name, mse)
\end{verbatim}

The first variable on the list is \verb"totalwgt_lb",
followed by \verb"birthwgt_lb".  Obviously, we can't use birth
weight to predict birthweight.

Similarly {\tt prglngth} has useful predictive power, but for the
office pool we assume pregnancy length (and the related variables)
are not known yet.

The first useful predictive variable {\tt babysex} which indicates
whether the baby is male or female.  In the NSFG dataset, boys are
about 0.3 lbs heavier.  So, assuming that the sex of the baby is
known, we can use it for prediction.

Next is {\tt race}, which indicates whether the respondent is white,
black, or other.  As an explanatory variable, race can be problematic.
In datasets like the NSFG, race is correlated with many other
variables, including income and other socioeconomic factors.  In a
regression model, race acts as a {\bf proxy variable},
so apparent correlations with race are often caused, at least in
part, by other factors.

The next variable on the list is {\tt nbrnaliv}, which indicates
whether the pregnancy yielded multiple births.  Twins and triplets
tend to be smaller than other babies, so if we know whether our
hypothetical co-worker is expecting twins, that would help.

Next on the list is {\tt paydu}, which indicates whether the
respondent owns her home.  It is one of several income-related
variables that turn out to be predictive.  In datasets like the NSFG,
income and wealth are correlated with just about everything.  In this
example, income is related to diet, health, health care, and other
factors likely to affect birth weight.

Some other the other variables on the list are things that would not
be known until later, like {\tt bfeedwks}, the number of weeks
the baby was breast fed.  We can't use these variables for prediction,
but you might want to speculate on reasons
{\tt bfeedwks} might be correlated with birth weight.

Sometimes you start with a theory and use data to test it.  Other
times you start with data and go looking for possible theories.
The second approach, which this section demonstrates, is
called {\bf data mining}.  An advantage of data mining is that it
can discover unexpected patterns.  A hazard is that many of the
patterns it discovers are either random or spurious.

Having identified potential explanatory variables, I tested a few
models and settled on this one:

\begin{verbatim}
    formula = ('totalwgt_lb ~ agepreg + C(race) + babysex==1 + '
               'nbrnaliv>1 + paydu==1 + totincr')
    results = smf.ols(formula, data=join).fit()
\end{verbatim}

This formula uses some syntax we have not seen yet:
{\tt C(race)} tells the formula parser (Patsy) to treat race as a
categorical variable, even though it is encoded numerically.

The encoding for {\tt babysex} is 1 for male, 2 for female; writing
{\tt babysex==1} converts it to boolean, True for male and false for
female.

Similarly {\tt nbrnaliv>1} is True for multiple births and 
{\tt paydu==1} is True for respondents who own their houses.

{\tt totincr} is encoded numerically from 1-14, which each increment
representing about \$5000 in annual income.  So we can treat these
values as numerical, expressed in units of \$5000.

Here are the results of the model:

\begin{verbatim}
Intercept	        6.63	(0)
C(race)[T.2]	        0.357	(5.43e-29)
C(race)[T.3]	        0.266	(2.33e-07)
babysex == 1[T.True]	0.295	(5.39e-29)
nbrnaliv > 1[T.True]   -1.38	(5.1e-37)
paydu == 1[T.True]	0.12	(0.000114)
agepreg	                0.00741	(0.0035)
totincr	                0.0122	(0.00188)
\end{verbatim}

The estimated parameters for race are larger than I expected,
especially since we have controlled for income.  The encoding
is 1 for white, 2 for black, and 3 for other.  Babies of white
mothers are lighter than babies of other races by 0.27--0.36 lbs.

As we've already seen, boys are heavier by about 0.3 lbs;
twins and other multiplets are lighter by 1.4 lbs.

People who own their homes have heavier babies by about 0.12 lbs,
even when we control for income.  The parameter for mother's
age is smaller than what we saw in Section~\ref{multiple}, which
suggests that some of the other variables are correlated with
age, probably including {\tt paydu} and {\tt totincr}.

All of these variables are statistically significant, some with
very low p-values, but 
$R^2$ is only 0.06, still quite small.
RMSE without using the model is 1.27 lbs; with the model it drops
to 1.23.  So your chance of winning the pool is not substantially
improved.  Sorry!



\section{Logistic regression}

In the previous examples, some of the explanatory variables are
numerical, some categorical, and some boolean (which is really
categorical).  But the dependent variable was numerical.

Linear regression can be generalized to handle other kinds of
dependent variables.  If the dependent variable is boolean, the
process is called {\bf logistic regression}.  If the dependent
variable is a positive, integer count, it's called {\bf Poisson
regression}.  These forms of regression are known as
{\bf generalized linear models}.

\section{Exercises}

\begin{exercise}

Section~\ref{} presents a hypothetical office pool where friends
of a pregnant woman try to guess the baby's birth weight.  Suppose,
instead, that the goal is to predict the date of birth.  Assuming that
bets are placed during the 30th week of pregnancy, what variables
could you use to make the best prediction?  You should limit yourself
to variables that are known before the birth, and likely to be available
to the people in the pool.

\section{Random Variables}
\index{random variable}
\index{variable!random}

A {\bf random variable} represents a process that generates a random
number.  Random variables are usually written with a capital letter,
like $X$.  You can think of a random variable as a random number
generator.
\index{cumulative distribution function}
\index{CDF}

For example, here is a definition for a class that represents
random variables:
%
\begin{verbatim}
class RandomVariable(object):
    """Parent class for all random variables."""
\end{verbatim}

And here is a random variable with an exponential distribution:
\index{exponential distribution}
\index{distribution!exponential}
%
\begin{verbatim}
class Exponential(RandomVariable):
    def __init__(self, lam):
        self.lam = lam

    def Generate(self):
        return random.expovariate(self.lam)
\end{verbatim}

The \verb"__init__" method takes the parameter, $\lambda$, and stores
it as an attribute.  The {\tt Generate} method returns a random value
from the exponential distribution with that parameter.  \index{init
  method} \index{method!init}

Each time you invoke {\tt Generate}, you get a different value.  The
value you get is called a {\bf random variate}, which is why many
function names in the {\tt random} module include the word ``variate.''
\index{random variate}
\index{variate!random}

If I were just generating exponential variates, I would not bother to
define a new class; I would use {\tt random.expovariate}.  But for
other distributions it might be useful to use RandomVariable objects.
For example, the Erlang distribution is an analytic distribution with
parameters $\lambda$ and $k$ (see
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_distribution}).
\index{Erlang distribution}
\index{distribution!Erlang}

One way to generate values from an Erlang distribution is to add
$k$ values from an exponential distribution with the same $\lambda$.
Here's an implementation:
%
\begin{verbatim}
class Erlang(RandomVariable):
    def __init__(self, lam, k):
        self.lam = lam
        self.k = k
        self.expo = Exponential(lam)

    def Generate(self):
        total = 0
        for i in range(self.k):
            total += self.expo.Generate()
        return total
\end{verbatim}

The \verb"__init__" method creates an Exponential object with the
given parameter; then {\tt Generate} uses it.  In general,
\verb"__init__" can take any set of parameters and the {\tt
  Generate} function can implement any random process.


\section{Functions of random variables}
\index{random variables}
\index{CDF}

Suppose we have two random variables, $X$ and $Y$, represented
by RandomVariable objects.
How can we compute the distribution of the sum $Z = X + Y$?
\index{random variable}
\index{variable!random}
\index{sum}

One option is to write a RandomVariable object that generates
the sum:
%
\begin{verbatim}
class Sum(RandomVariable):
    def __init__(X, Y):
        self.X = X
        self.Y = Y

    def Generate():
        return X.Generate() + Y.Generate()
\end{verbatim}

Given any RandomVariables, $X$ and $Y$, we can create a Sum
object that represents $Z$.  Then we can use a sample from $Z$ to
approximate $\CDF_{Z}$.

This approach is simple and versatile, but not very efficient; we
have to generate a large sample to estimate $\CDF_{Z}$ accurately, and
even then it is not exact.



\begin{exercise}

%TODO: do this as an example
If you are given Pmf objects, you can compute the distribution of
the sum by enumerating all pairs of values:
\index{Pmf object}
%
\begin{verbatim}
for x in pmf_x.Values():
    for y in pmf_y.Values():
        z = x + y
\end{verbatim}

Write a function that takes $PMF_{X}$ and
$PMF_{Y}$ and returns a new Pmf that represents the distribution of
the sum $Z = X + Y$.

Write a similar function that computes the PMF of $Z = max(X, Y)$.

\end{exercise}



\section{Why normal?}
\label{why_normal}
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

I said earlier that normal distributions are amenable to analysis,
but I didn't say why.  One reason is that they are
closed under linear transformation and convolution.  To explain what
that means, it will help to introduce some notation.
\index{analysis}
\index{random variable}
\index{variable!random}

If the distribution of a random variable, X, is
normal with parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$, you can write
%
\[ X \sim \normal (\mu, \sigma^{2})\]
%
where the symbol $\sim$ means ``is distributed'' and the script letter
$\normal$ stands for ``normal.''

%The other analytic distributions in this chapter are sometimes
%written $\mathrm{Exponential}(\lambda)$, $\mathrm{Pareto}(x_m,
%\alpha)$ and, for lognormal, $\mathrm{Log}-\normal (\mu,
%\sigma^2)$.

A linear transformation of $X$ is something like $X' = a X + b$, where
$a$ and $b$ are real numbers.\index{linear transformation}
A family of distributions is closed under
linear transformation if $X'$ is in the same family as $X$.  The normal
distribution has this property; if $X \sim \normal (\mu,
\sigma^2)$,

\[ X' \sim \normal (a \mu + b, a^{2} \sigma^2)\]

Normal distributions are also closed under addition.  
If $Z = X + Y$ and
$X \sim \normal (\mu_{X}, \sigma_{X}^{2})$ and
$Y \sim \normal (\mu_{Y}, \sigma_{Y}^{2})$ then
%
\[ Z \sim \normal (\mu_X + \mu_Y, \sigma_X^2 + \sigma_Y^2) \]
%
The other distributions we have looked at do not have these
properties.
\index{convolution}



\section{Central limit theorem}
\label{CLT}
\index{Central Limit Theorem}

So far we have seen:

\begin{itemize}

\item If we add values drawn from normal distributions, the distribution
of the sum is normal.
\index{sum}
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

\item If we add values drawn from other distributions, the sum does not
generally have one of the analytic distributions we have seen.

\end{itemize}

But it turns out that if we add up a large number of values from
almost any distribution, the distribution of the sum converges to
normal.

More specifically, if the distribution of the values has mean and
standard deviation $\mu$ and $\sigma$, the distribution of the sum is
approximately $\normal(n \mu, n \sigma^2)$.

This is called the {\bf Central Limit Theorem}.  It is one of the
most useful tools for statistical analysis, but it comes with
caveats:

\begin{itemize}

\item The values have to be drawn independently.
\index{independent}

\item The values have to come from the same distribution (although
  this requirement can be relaxed).
\index{identical}

\item The values have to be drawn
  from a distribution with finite mean and variance, so most Pareto
  distributions are out.
\index{mean}
\index{variance}
\index{Pareto distribution}
\index{distribution!Pareto}
\index{exponential distribution}
\index{distribution!exponential}

\item The number of values you need before you see convergence depends
  on the skewness of the distribution.  Sums from an exponential
  distribution converge for small sample sizes.  Sums from a
  lognormal distribution require much larger sizes.
\index{lognormal distribution}
\index{distribution!lognormal}

\end{itemize}

The Central Limit Theorem explains, at least in part, the prevalence
of normal distributions in the natural world.  Most characteristics of
animals and other life forms are affected by a large number of genetic
and environmental factors whose effect is additive.  The characteristics
we measure are the sum of a large number of small effects, so their
distribution tends to be normal.

\begin{exercise}
If I draw a sample, $x_{1} .. x_{n}$, independently from a
distribution with finite mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, what is
the distribution of the sample mean:

\[ \xbar = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i \]
%
As $n$ increases, what happens to the variance of the sample mean?
Hint: review Section~\ref{why_normal}.

\section{Conditional probability}
\index{conditional probability}
\index{probability!conditional}

Imagine that someone you know is pregnant, and it is the beginning of
Week 39.  What is the chance that the baby will be born in the next
week?  How much does the answer change if it's a first baby?

We can answer these questions by computing a {\bf conditional
probability}, which is (ahem!) a probability that depends on a condition.
In this case, the condition is that we know the baby didn't arrive
during Weeks 0--38.

Here's one way to do it:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Given a PMF, generate a fake cohort of 1000 pregnancies.
For each number of weeks, x, the number of pregnancies with
duration x~is 1000 PMF(x).
\index{cohort}

\item Remove from the cohort all pregnancies with length less than 39.
\index{pregnancy length}
\index{length!pregnancy}

\item Compute the PMF of the remaining durations; the result is the
conditional PMF.

\item Evaluate the conditional PMF at $x = 39$ weeks.

\end{enumerate}

This algorithm is conceptually clear, but not very efficient.
A simple alternative is to remove from the distribution the values
less than 39 and then renormalize.

\begin{exercise}
Write a function that implements either of these algorithms and
computes the probability that a baby will be born during Week 39,
given that it was not born prior to Week 39.

Generalize the function to compute the

\section{\Poincare}
%\index{\Poincare, Henry}

Henri \Poincare~was a French mathematician who taught at the Sorbonne
around 1900.  The following anecdote about him is probably fabricated,
but it makes an interesting probability problem.
\index{bread police}

Supposedly \Poincare~suspected that his local bakery was selling
loaves of bread that were lighter than the advertised weight of 1 kg,
so every day for a year he bought a loaf of bread, brought it home and
weighed it.  At the end of the year, he plotted the distribution of
his measurements and showed that it fit a normal distribution with
mean 950 g and standard deviation 50 g.  He brought this evidence to
the bread police, who gave the baker a warning.
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

For the next year, \Poincare~continued the practice of weighing his
bread every day.  At the end of the year, he found that the average
weight was 1000 g, just as it should be, but again he complained to
the bread police, and this time they fined the baker.
\index{symmetric}

Why?  Because the shape of the distribution was asymmetric.  Unlike
the normal distribution, it was skewed to the right, which is
consistent with the hypothesis that the baker was still making 950 g
loaves, but deliberately giving \Poincare~the heavier ones.


\begin{exercise}
Write a program that simulates a baker who chooses $n$ loaves from a
distribution with mean 950 g and standard deviation 50 g, and gives
the heaviest one to \Poincare.  What value of $n$ yields a
distribution with mean 1000 g?  What is the standard deviation?

Compare this distribution to a normal distribution with the same mean
and the same standard deviation.  Is the difference in the shape of
the distribution big enough to convince the bread police?

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
\label{coef_var}
If you go to a dance where partners are paired up randomly, what
percentage of opposite sex couples will you see where the woman is
taller than the man?
\index{dance}
\index{height}
\index{Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System}
\index{BRFSS}

In the BRFSS (see Section~\ref{lognormal}), the distribution of
heights is roughly normal with parameters $\mu$ = 178 cm and
$\sigma^2 = 59.4$ cm for men, and $\mu$ = 163 cm and $\sigma^2 = 52.8$ cm for
women.

\section{Streaks and hot spots}
\index{streak}
\index{hot spot}
\index{random}

People do not have very good intuition for random processes.  If you
ask people to generate ``random'' numbers, they tend to generate
sequences that are random-looking, but actually more ordered than real
random sequences.  Conversely, if you show them a real random
sequence, they tend to see patterns where there are none.

An example of the second phenomenon is that many people believe
in ``streaks'' in sports: a player that has been successful recently
is said to have a ``hot hand;'' a player that has been unsuccessful is
``in a slump.''
\index{hot hand}
\index{slump}
\index{sport}

Statisticians have tested these hypotheses in a number of sports, and
the consistent result is that there is no such thing as a
streak\footnote{For example, see Gilovich, Vallone and Tversky, ``The
  hot hand in basketball: On the misperception of random sequences,''
  1985.}.  If you assume that each attempt is independent of previous
attempts, you will see occasional long strings of successes or
failures.  These apparent streaks are not sufficient evidence that
there is any relationship between successive attempts.
\index{clustering illusion}
\index{spatial pattern}

A related phenomenon is the clustering illusion, which is the
tendency to see clusters in spatial patterns that are actually
random (see \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_illusion}).
\index{simulation!Monte Carlo}
\index{Monte Carlo}

To test whether an apparent
cluster is likely to be meaningful, we can simulate the behavior
of a random system to see whether it is likely to produce a similar
cluster.  This process is called {\bf Monte Carlo} simulation because
generating random numbers is reminiscent of casino games (and Monte
Carlo is famous for its casino).

\begin{exercise}
If there are 10 players in a basketball game and each one takes
15 shots during the course of the game, and each shot has a
50\% probability of going in, what is the probability that 
you will see, in a given game, at least one player who
hits 10 shots in a row?  If you watch a season of 82 games,
what are the chances you will see at least one streak of
10 hits or misses?
\index{basketball}
\index{simulation!Monte Carlo}
\index{Monte Carlo}

This problem demonstrates some strengths and weaknesses of Monte
Carlo simulation.  A strength is that it is often easy and fast
to write a simulation, and no great knowledge of probability is
required.  A weakness is that estimating the probability of
rare events can take a long time!  A little bit of analysis can
save a lot of computing.

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}
In 1941 Joe DiMaggio got at least one hit
in 56 consecutive games\footnote{See
  \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitting_streak}.}.  Many baseball fans
consider this streak the greatest achievement in any sport in history,
because it was so unlikely.

Use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability that
any player in major league baseball will have a hitting streak
of 57 or more games in the next century.

\begin{exercise}
A cancer cluster is defined by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
as ``greater-than-expected number of cancer cases that occurs within a
group of people in a geographic area over a period of
time.\footnote{From \url{http://cdc.gov/nceh/clusters/about.htm}.}''
\index{cluster}
\index{cancer cluster}
\index{Gawande, Atul}

Many people interpret a cancer cluster as evidence of an environmental
hazard, but many scientists and statisticians think that investigating
cancer clusters is a waste of time\footnote{See Gawande, ``The Cancer
  Cluster Myth,'' {\em New Yorker}, Feb 8, 1997.}.  Why?  One reason
(among several) is that identifying cancer clusters is a classic case
of the Sharpshooter Fallacy (see
\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_sharpshooter_fallacy}).
\index{sharpshooter fallacy}
\index{fallacy!sharpshooter}

Nevertheless, when someone reports a cancer cluster, the CDC is
obligated to investigate.  According to their web page:

\begin{quote}

``Investigators develop a `case' definition, a time period of concern,
  and the population at risk. They then calculate the expected number
  of cases and compare them to the observed number. A cluster is
  confirmed when the observed/expected ratio is greater than 1.0, and
  the difference is statistically significant.''

\end{quote}

\begin{enumerate}

\item Suppose that a particular cancer has an incidence of 1 case per
  thousand people per year.  If you follow a particular cohort of 100
  people for 10 years, you would expect to see about 1 case.  If you
  saw two cases, that would not be very surprising, but more than than
  two would be rare.\index{cohort}

  Write a program that simulates a large number of cohorts over
  a 10 year period and estimates the distribution of total cases.

\item An observation is considered statistically significant if its
  probability by chance alone, called a p-value, is less than 5\%.
  In a cohort of 100 people over 10 years, how many cases would you
  have to see to meet this criterion?

\item Now imagine that you divide a population of 10000 people into 100
  cohorts and follow them for 10 years.  What is the chance that at
  least one of the cohorts will have a ``statistically significant''
  cluster?  What if we require a p-value of 1\%?

\item Now imagine that you arrange 10000 people in a $100 \times 100$
  grid and follow them for 10 years.  What is the chance that there
  will be at least one $10 \times 10$ block anywhere in the grid
  with a statistically significant cluster?

\item Finally, imagine that you follow a grid of 10000 people for 30
  years.  What is the chance that there will be a 10-year interval
  at some point with a $10 \times 10$ block anywhere in the grid
  with a statistically significant cluster?

\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}




\section{Efficient resampling}
\index{resampling}

Anyone reading this book who has prior training in statistics probably
laughed when they saw Figure~\ref{length_deltas_cdf}, because I used a
lot of computer power to simulate something I could have figured out
analytically.
\index{analysis}
\index{pregnancy length}
\index{length!pregnancy}

Obviously mathematical analysis is not the focus of this book.  I am
willing to use computers to do things the ``dumb'' way, because I
think it is easier for beginners to understand simulations, and easier
to demonstrate that they are correct.  So as long as the simulations
don't take too long to run, I don't feel guilty for skipping the
analysis.

However, there are times when a little analysis can save a lot of
computing, and Figure~\ref{length_deltas_cdf} is one of those times.
\index{mean, difference in}

Remember that we were testing the observed difference in the mean between
pregnancy lengths for $n = 4413$ first babies and $m = 4735$ others.  We formed
the pooled distribution for all babies, drew samples with sizes $n$ and
$m$, and computed the difference in sample means.
\index{sample mean}

Instead, we could directly compute the distribution of the difference
in sample means.  To get started, let's think about what a sample mean
is: we draw $n$ samples from a distribution, add them up, and
divide by n.  If the distribution has mean $\mu$ and variance
$\sigma^2$, then by the Central Limit Theorem, we know that the sum of
the samples is $\normal (n \mu, n \sigma^2)$.
\index{normal distribution}
\index{distribution!normal}
\index{Gaussian distribution}
\index{distribution!Gaussian}

To figure out the distribution of the sample means, we have to invoke
one of the properties of the normal distribution: if X~is
$\normal (\mu, \sigma^2)$,

\[ aX~+~b~\sim~\normal(a \mu~+~b, a^{2} \sigma^2)\]

When we divide by n, $a = 1/n$ and $b = 0$, so
%
\[ X/n~\sim~\normal(\mu /n, \sigma^2/ n^{2}) \]
%
So the distribution of the sample mean is $\normal (\mu, \sigma^2/n)$.

To get the distribution of the difference between two sample means,
we invoke another property of the normal distribution: if $X_{1}$ is
$\normal (\mu_{1}, \sigma_{1}^{2})$ and $X_{2}$ is
$\normal (\mu_{2}, \sigma_{2}^{2})$,
%
\[ aX_1 + bX_2 \sim \normal(a\mu_1 + b\mu_2, 
                                 a^2\sigma_1^2 + b^2\sigma_2^2) \]
%
So as a special case:
%
\[ X_1 - X_2 \sim \normal(\mu_1 - \mu_2, 
                               \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2) \]
%
Putting it all together, we conclude that the sample in
Figure~\ref{length_deltas_cdf} is drawn from 
$\normal (0, f \sigma^2)$, where $f = 1/n~+~1/m$.  Plugging in
n = 4413 and m = 4735, we expect the difference of sample means to be
$\normal (0, 0.0032)$.
\index{p-value}

We can use {\tt erf.NormalCdf} to compute the p-value of the observed 
difference in the means:
%
\begin{verbatim}
delta = 0.078
sigma = math.sqrt(0.0032)
left = erf.NormalCdf(-delta, 0.0, sigma)
right = 1 - erf.NormalCdf(delta, 0.0, sigma)
\end{verbatim}

The sum of the left and right tails is the p-value, 0.168, which is
pretty close to what we estimated by resampling, 0.166.

\section{Significance}

In the previous exercise, you compared the gestation period for first
babies and others; if things worked out, you found that first
babies are born about 13 hours later, on average.
\index{apparent effect}

A difference like that is called an {\bf apparent effect}; that is,
there might be something going on, but we are not yet sure.  There are
several questions we still want to ask:

\begin{itemize}

\item If the two groups have different means, what about other {\bf
  summary statistics}, like median and variance?  Can we be more
  precise about how the groups differ?
\index{summary statistic}

\item Is it possible that the difference we saw could occur by chance,
  even if the groups we compared were actually the same?  If so,
  we would conclude that the effect was not {\bf statistically
    significant}.
\index{statistically significant}
\index{significance}


\item Is it possible that the apparent effect is due to selection bias or
  some other error in the experimental setup?  If so, then we might
  conclude that the effect is an {\bf artifact}; that is, something we
  created (by accident) rather than found. 
\index{artifact}

\end{itemize}

Answering these questions will take most of the rest of this book.

\section{Relative risk}
\label{relative.risk}
\index{relative risk}

We started with the question, ``Do first babies arrive late?''  To
make that more precise, let's say that a baby is early if it is born
during Week 37 or earlier, on time if it is born during Week 38, 39 or
40, and late if it is born during Week 41 or later.  Ranges like these
that are used to group data are called {\bf bins}.
\index{bin}
\index{{\tt risk.py}}

\begin{exercise}
Create a file named {\tt risk.py}.
Write functions named {\tt ProbEarly}, {\tt ProbOnTime} and
{\tt ProbLate} that take a PMF and compute the fraction of births
that fall into each bin.  Hint: write a generalized function
that these functions call.

Make three PMFs, one for first babies, one for others, and one for
all live births.  For each PMF, compute the probability of being
born early, on time, or late.

One way to summarize data like this is with {\bf relative risk},
which is a ratio of two probabilities.  For example, the probability
that a first baby is born early is 18.2\%.  For other babies it is
16.8\%, so the relative risk is 1.08.  That means that first babies
are about 8\% more likely to be early.

Write code to confirm that result, then compute the relative risks of
being born on time and being late.  You can download a solution
from \url{http://thinkstats2.com/risk.py}.

\end{exercise}

There are two ways to draw a sample from a population: with and
without replacement.  If you imagine drawing marbles from an
urn,\footnote{The marbles-in-an-urn scenario is a standard model for
  random sampling processes (see
  \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Urn_problem}).} ``replacement'' means
putting the marbles back as you go (and stirring), so the population
is the same for every draw.  ``Without replacement,'' means that each
marble can only be drawn once, so the remaining population is
different after each draw.

In Python, sampling with replacement can be implemented with
{\tt random.random} to choose a percentile rank, or {\tt random.choice}
to choose an element from a sequence.  Sampling without replacement
is provided by {\tt random.sample}.
